				<h1 class="center">10 Ways to Increase Production and Reduce Costs <u>Without</u> Capital Expenditure</h1>
				<br />
				<p>Would you find it easier to justify improvement projects if they could be delivered using existing internal resources and aligned with your company's existing strategy?</p>
				<p>Digital transformation projects typically involve considerable upfront costs - particularly when external consultants are involved. This is due to the belief it's all about implementing technology, often branded the "solution".</p>
				<p>When focus is on delivery of a solution these costs are justified as a means to an end. However the end result rarely delivers the promised return on investment. There's no shortage of idustry reports describing the proportion of failed transformation projects if you need evidence of this.</p> 
				<p>Fortunately there's another way. Even better, because the first step is to understand your company's current situation and identify the areas in which projects will have the greatest impact - something you can do yourself with the information we make available for free - there's no cost associated with getting started.</p>
				<p>Before you ask: the statement at the top of this page isn't a falsehood. Companies who've implemented the recommendations in our report have seen improvements in productivity and efficiency even before spending anything on technology.</p>

				<p class="tab">Automation suppliers, vendors and solutions providers want to sell you the products they've invested huge amounts in developing/getting familiar with, not the technology which best delivers your strategic objectives.</p>
				<p class="tab">Maximise the return on investment your company sees from its industrial automation. Understand the areas where your current strategy may be falling short and allocate resources to where they'll have most effect.</p>

				<h2>Why is this service free?</h2>
				<p class="tab">Our business is about helping companies increase their efficiency through better investment in technology, but we know our services won't be a fit for everyone and not everyone is a fit for us. By making our expertise available to all we get to help a larger number of people, and know some will see our approach as a good fit with their objectives and want to take things further.</p>
				<h2>Who I am and why you should listen to what we say</h2>
				<p class="tab">I'm Richard Banyard, Managing Director of Op-tec Systems; a company experienced in helping organisations, big and small, maximise their returns from automation investment for well over two decades. My team and I gained our expertise working in the process industries, where technology must not only enable continuous improvement, but also meet onerous requirements and function in the harshest environments.</p>
				<h2>Don't just take my word for it</h2>
