				<p class="tab justify">800xA is the world's leading distributed control system. However its power and flexibility come with a cost. It's not known as the easiest system to work with - making it hard to find quality independent support, ensure updates and backups are managed correctly, and the configuration keeps pace with changes to plant and operations.</p>
                <p><b>Which of these 4 activities do you need help with?</b></p>
				<p class="tab justify">If you're struggling with any or all of these, you'll benefit from an 'automation reboot' session. A 30 minute call with an experienced engineer who will understand your issues then suggest ways to make these tasks more manageable.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Routine maintenance and updates. If these are left too long it can take days rather than minutes to recover from system failures or security incidents.</li>
                    <li>Changes and modifications. Out of date control systems aren't fit for purpose, leading people to work around, rather than benefit from them.</li>
                    <li>Integrating 3rd party equipment. Crucial to capture, store and analyse valuable process data but often seen as a nice to have, then never done.</li> 
                    <li>Adding extra features and functions. Your sophisticated DCS isn't delivering the benefits promised thanks to constraints during the initial project. It now feels too hard or too expensive to add extra functions.</li>
                </ol>
            	<p class="tab justify">You'll leave the call with clear actions you can take, not a recommendation to give us money. Arrange it now:</p>
