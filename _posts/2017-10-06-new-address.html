<p>We've moved! Things were getting a little tight where we were, and with customers throughout the UK locating ourselves more centrally makes sense as we continue to grow.</p><!--more-->
<p>Our new home is Broadstone Mill in Reddish, Stockport. More specifically, the Stockport Business &amp; Innovation Centre (SBIC), located on the 3rd floor of this imposing landmark.</p>

<p>A legacy of Manchester's textile manufacturing past, when constructed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadstone_Mill,_Reddish">Broadstone</a> was the largest cotton spinning mill in the world, employing 700 people. Specialised in spinning the highest quality Egyptian cotton, the mill was 4 years in construction (1903-07) and ran until 1959.</p>
<p>SBIC will provide a great base for the company, while allowing existing staff to remain based in the West Midlands. Also, there's a fantastic view over Greater Manchester through the windows.</p>
