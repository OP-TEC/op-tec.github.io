<p>Recently, a PLC controlled heating system failed, causing the product to go over temperature resulting in substantial consequential losses.</p><!--more-->
<p>An engineer dispatched to deal with the problem found that the CPU was not reading inputs, and replaced the input module to no effect. He condemned the system and recommended replacement in its entirety.</p>
<p>The customer, not happy with the proposed cost and delay to operations, took a second opinion.</p>
<p>A diagnostic scan revealed the root cause â€“ incompatibility between the new input module and older CPU firmware. The firmware was upgraded, the plant set to work and production was soon back to normal.</p>
<p>Had preventative maintenance been implemented keeping the CPU firmware up-to-date, the new input module would have worked when installed and loss of production would have been minimised.</p>
