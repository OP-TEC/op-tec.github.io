Is this anything to do with digital transformation?            How are you different?                          Are you talking about Industry 4. 0?        Yes.         Longer answer: your specific requirements and current technology determine the solution we will offer. Almost everything we work with could be termed 'Industry 4. 0'. To learn more about Industry 4. 0, and the distinction between this term and the 'forth industrial revolution' Wikipedia's definition is a good place to start.         Back to questions         Is this anything to do with digital transformation?        Everything! We specialise in moving companies to being 'data-driven' enterprises. Unless you're still faxing purchase orders you'll be some way towards this goal already. But chances are you could do more to gather and use data to make better decisions in real-time.         Back to questions         How are you different?        As an independent service provider, it's not in our interest to sell you expensive hardware or software. We measure success on your business performance. By recommending the most cost-effective method for achieving your goals we ensure you get the best return on investment possible.         Many potential clients we speak to think investing in Industry 4. 0 technology requires huge capital investment, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. It is possible to retro-fit sensors to existing equipment and the return on investment of doing so can be huge.         Op-tec is well-known for supporting legacy systems and we always try to utilise as much of your existing technology as possible. Extending the life of equipment makes economic and environmental sense, so we will always recommend doing so if it's a viable option.         Back to questions             "

Science has proven time and time again that doing things such as keeping a 'gratitude journal', or writing what went well, and what didn't, each day increases well-being and performance. 				Unfortunately, much of this science is published and communicated by psychologists and let's say their messaging doesn't always appeal to technically-minded people! So here's my attempt to get you thinking about small things you can do which won't intrude on how you operate daily: 								This article from McKinsey &amp; Company suggests:  expressing gratitude to someone at least once a day , can:  improve mental health, renew energy . . . and encourage self improvement . It includes many more practical tips on how to develop a compassionate leadership style, beneficial at any time but particularly during change or crisis. 								Need convincing that reflection increases learning and productivity? Research by HEC Paris (a business school), explained below by one of the authors, suggests not only this but also that confidence improves.

    "title": "Much ado about heating",
    "body": "2021/03/08 - There is much debate on the efficacy of heat pumps for domestic heating, but heat pumps alone are not the answer. There are a number of technologies in the heat transfer, energy storage and electricity supply industries that need to be integrated, and done successfully, the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts. In an attempt to add light as well as heat to the discussion we must consider the heat pump paradox: When you need it most it gives you least. And to make sure it gives you enough in the worst case scenario, you have to over-size it. The worst case scenario would be an air source heat pump operating in the depths of winter. Being expected to produce viable domestic hot water and heat a dwelling simultaneously really is scraping the bottom of the cost-efficiency barrel and should be considered as the desperate last resort. It will work, but the plant will be uneconomically oversized, it will be working at the limits of its envelope, there will be frequent periods without heat due to defrosts, efficiency will be at its lowest and the demand for, and hence the price of, electricity will be at its highest. This is what the heat-pump user remembers long after the glossy advertising brochures have been recycled. The air-source heat pump needs some help. Consider adding alternative resources, such as a borehole to transfer heat from deep beneath the ground. If the ground can offer a higher grade source of heat than ambient air, then it would make sense to use that as the preferred heat source. The challenge then is that as surely as digging coal out, or pumping oil out of the ground, the energy source viability will be depleted gradually unless you have the luxury of local volcanic activity, which can bring its own problems. You still have the issue of high electricity price, but the plant could be more economically sized, and efficiency for at least the first year will far exceed what air source could achieve. In summer, domestic hot water is the dominant but lesser heating demand, air temperature is high, sun is shining on the photo-voltaic panels, fresh breezes are spinning the turbines, and on the smart grid electricity demand and hence the price, is low. Back to the heat pump paradox: When you need it least it gives you most. And if a heat pump is sized for winter operation then it will give you far more than you actually need in summer. The excess capacity can be used to replace the heat extracted from the ground during winter whilst providing the benefit of comfort cooling, and this can be done while electricity is plentiful and cheap and the air heat source is good, so the ground can now used as an efficient heat sink to store cheap energy when the heat pump efficiency and cost-effectiveness is at its best. Summer is the perfect opportunity to deposit heat into the energy bank surrounding the borehole, for use later, in winter. Dual source, dual sink heat pump technology is well proven in hundreds of commercial and retail premises throughout the land, and the principles hold good to fulfil a domestic role. Smart Grid technology is also well proven and can feed electricity price and availability data into controllers equipped with the intelligence to use it. Knowledge is having information. Wisdom is knowing how to use knowledge. The logical steps would be the combination of the air source heat pump with its ground resource counterpart, capitalising on the best efficiencies at the best times as identified by smart grid pricing, to maximise heat transfer and minimise expenditure on electricity. Integrating an intelligent controller that can measure and record the heat transfer from air-resource to load, or air-resource to ground-resource, or ground-resource to load, and learn to optimise the energy usage, would enable selection of the most appropriate operating mode to maximise the overall annual efficiency of not merely an intelligent heat pump installation, but wise heat pump operation.

    "title": "Maximise your ROI from technology projects",
    "body": "2021/02/09 - There are several pitfalls I see affecting technology projects time and time again. To help clients avoid them I’ve written a lot about the common problems I see and how to overcome them. The blog post is the first of many which aim to share this knowledge with a wider audience. Productisation: Many products, services and ‘solutions’ offered by consultancies and vendors aren’t designed to address the needs of the end-user. Instead they are designed to be easy to sell repeatably, and generate opportunities for recurring revenue. This isn’t a problem in itself, in terms of technology it would be cost prohibitive to engineer solutions to every problem from first principles. But it does mean the components of every project or service are ‘productised’ to some degree and systems sold on the merits of these products. Conflicts of interest arise when the end-user/purchaser hasn’t been able to translate their long-term strategic objectives into the functional requirements. These don’t just help determine the most suitable solutions from the marketplace but also the true measures of success. When purchasing, engineering or project management decisions aren’t based on strategic objectives. Not being able to relate products to the benefits they deliver can lead to undesirable outcomes… This is you if the sales presentation ‘chimed’ - the solution discussed delivered the key objectives your management team laid out in their strategy meeting – but the final solution failed to live up to expectations. Your procurement function may have focused on costs rather than benefits. If so, they will have pushed the supplier to reduce cost, meaning the add-on components needed to deliver the key benefits were removed from the scope of supply. Perhaps it was your supplier’s own engineering team. A common situation is the solution ‘sold’ is uncomfortable for engineers to deliver, due to its complexity or novelty. They may not have experience working with ‘products’ proposed, so don’t get the best out of them. They may be uncertain the resulting solution would meet more basic criteria such as availability and reliability so remove ‘bells and whistles’. Another group who could be responsible are project managers on either side. They may not be properly incentivised to deliver strategic objectives. Or could see hitting budget or timing expectations as more important measures of success. In which case they’re likely to unknowingly compromise the return a project delivers. Whatever the cause, a lack of clear communication of, and focus on, the benefits to be delivered and why they are so important to achieve can result in a project’s value not being fully realised. Fixing scope: Another way focus shifts to costs and deadlines, is when a project’s scope is fixed prematurely. Yes, late changes cost more to make than they would if they were picked up earlier in the project… But, suppliers never have the time and resources to fully engineer a solution during the bid and proposal stage. Likely similarities with past projects were used to quickly create a specification and price, then this work ‘tweaked’ to meet any unique requirements. Internal Sales Engineers have a significant influence on the design, but they tend to be generalists rather than subject matter experts. It’s only a good way into the project when people with specialist knowledge of the technology have taken every requirement into account (as they finish design work and you move to the build phase). Now ask yourself if it’s sensible to the fix the scope at the beginning of the project, before subject matter experts have been given time to fully evaluate the requirements and complete the detailed design. Doing so risks missing out of the knowledge and expertise they bring to the project. Yes, making changes during the second half of this process is more costly. That’s why any changes proposed must be carefully scrutinised against the strategic objectives of the project. Assuming the original scope will achieve the outcomes you desire, regardless of any new knowledge acquired by subject matter experts, is very dangerous. It can easily lead to change requests being evaluated with a focus on cost and time, with benefits the project is meant to deliver taking a back seat. Integration: Technology projects are a focused period of activity, they typically involve working with suppliers, maybe also advisors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties. As such they are often thought of as a standalone activity, executed alongside operations then delivered and completed. This is a trap, which many organisations who fail to properly integrate new technology fall into. The organisation isn’t aligned with the technology, so can’t use it to best effect and so expected returns aren’t realised. In a future article I’ll discuss this in more detail.

    "body": "2021/02/03 - Tennants Fine Chemicals Ltd supplies a global customer base with around 24,000 tonnes of chemicals a year from Leek, Staffordshire, plus seven other sites across the UK, Americas, Europe, and China. It is the UK’s leading producer of acetate esters and aroma chemicals; its products are used in cosmetics, metalworking fluids, paper, plastics, oilfield exploration, pharmaceuticals and other applications. “Our processes are largely but not fully automated,” says Phil Malpas BEng (Hons), Electrical Controls and Instrumentation Engineer with Tennants. “Some plants are more automated than others. We have a centralised DCS and separate SCADA system. ” Aligning automated and manual systems: DCS and SCADA are not always found in the same production environment. Here, the DCS is process-oriented, tightly controlling each step of an operation. While the SCADA is focused on acquisition and collation of the data operations personnel use to make decisions. “When we run batch sequencing, for example, we can make the systems pretty automated. The chemicals will run through a system on their own, with limited operator input,” Phil says. “We use the DCS to ensure the system is being controlled or processes within the normal design operating window. A vessel’s pressure might be between 0 - 1 bar, for example; if you have over pressure, you might have a data concern. Where we have a pressure transmitter and monitor, the basic logic system will provide an alert to a “door open” event, for example. ” A PLC is used to sequence control in a certain order and to maintain it in a safe way. Automation of data input reduces the risk of human error and helps prevent hazardous issues arising. Partners in time: Op-tec Systems has played an important role in the process of automation and upgrade at Tennants for nearly 20 years. It has helped the company to upgrade its hardware and software to the latest versions, clean up and document signal databases and system architecture. All of which has helped resolve several issues of monitoring and management. “We have installed new thermal, process and remote controllers. It has enabled improved visibility of the entire plant,” says Chemical Engineer Martin Higgs, based at the company’s Staffordshire facility. “Op-tec were instrumental in helping us to diagnose problems and create fixes. Since then, everything has been working fine. ” A long-term partnership: An important further improvement was the installation of a remote control system in a hazardous area at Tennants several years ago, also implemented by Op-tec. “Richard Banyard of Op-tec is an independent expert and has assisted with developing our system and maintaining the backroom DCS, providing technical assistance and support,” Phil explains. “He has also been assisting us with aspects of control such as cyber security. ” And now Tennants has automated its processes further. “We moved away from the manual intervention and operation of valves and pumps and put their operation onto the DeltaV system, a huge step forward for us,” says Martin Higgs. “This meant that the plant could be controlled mostly from the control room. A few years ago, we converted two of our oldest plants and put them onto the DeltaV system as well. In terms of efficiency, this is a major benefit. ” Op-tec has also helped train Martin and colleagues to become more self-sufficient, and understand then resolve control system issues. In the future, Op-tec will support with system upgrades and extending automation further. The process of doing so will, inevitably, raise some issues. Manufacturers like Tennants appreciate improvement can be disruptive; examining and changing long-established practices can be uncomfortable but they are necessary in order to retain or regain competitiveness. The key to a successful transformation is to have a partner who understands what has already been achieved and what is being sought, and can help to map, plan and guide the company on the journey. "

    "title": "Using data to inform maintenance",
    "body": "2020/11/20 - How you use data analysis to inform maintenance activity can have a huge impact on the efficiency of your operations. It may never be possible to eliminate the risk of an unplanned shutdown entirely, but smart use of plant data can significantly reduce it. If you’re sick of praying for things to keep working until the end of the day / week / month / year, keep reading! Below are simple explanations of common maintenance approaches. If you’re new to the concept of data-informed maintenance, know there are companies out there already pushing far beyond these techniques. For example, using machine learning to identify external factors such as weather patterns or employee behaviour to better inform predictions. Or allowing their systems to automatically order spare parts and schedule preventative work before human operators have the chance to notice anything’s up. Most likely you’ll say to yourself “we already do this” as you read through. If so, ask whether your existing processes are as effective as they could be. We see people manually undertaking this work a lot, storing records on paper or retrieving it from ‘offline’ equipment only to import it into another system. So read on, then ask: ‘Could my organisation improve it’s maintenance regimes?’ Corrective maintenance: Wait until something breaks, then take action. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” Because it requires doing nothing this is often seen as the most cost-effective option. Only true if the cost of downtime, in-house expertise, and spare parts is less than those associated with a data-driven approach if this is the case. If equipment in question is critical to operations rapid repair or replacement will be necessary to minimise disruption. Also referred to as reactive maintenance. This approach risks significant costs should catastrophic failure occur, where repair or replacement is not possible within a defined timeframe. No data is needed for this approach. Information available is often used to diagnose the cause of failures after the event. e. g. replacing a blown bulb Preventive maintenance: Intervene before failure becomes likely. “When was the cambelt last changed? Maintenance activities are performed before they’re required; typically at predetermined intervals based on historical records or manufacturer recommendations. Sometimes referred to as ‘proactive maintenance’ this technique allows work to be carried out during planned shutdowns minimising disruption. Taking this approach means performing maintenance before it’s needed, so the assumption is the resource needed to do this if cheaper than implementing a more data-driven approach. This technique can be improved over time by using measurement, analysis and periodic testing to better inform service intervals. e. g. changing car engine oil every 10,000 miles Risk-based maintenance: Take the impact into account. “Get that boiler serviced before winter” The effect a failure will have on operations and it’s likelihood is used to allocate available resource efficiently. The condition of assets will also be monitored to ensure changing risks, as equipment and machinery ages, is taken into account. The quantity and quality of data used can vary widely, from the objective analysis of an employee to automated anaylsis of assets over time. It may also be useful to consider factors other than just equipment condition, such as market demand or stock levels.  Information gathered can also inform the schedule for replacing or upgrading equipment. e. g. waiting until a shutdown to install software updates Condition-based maintenance: Monitor ‘health’ for warning signs. “No signs of wear…“ Maintenance work is informed through performance monitoring of equipment. Typically, key parameters are recorded over time, and trends which indicate pending failure identified. Manual inspection during outages can also be used to determine when work needs to be carried out. Automated systems record device parameters over time. Maintenance is required when values deviate from ‘normal’ indicating the probability of a failure has increased to an unacceptable level. e. g. a motor drawing more current than usual Predictive maintenance: Specific thresholds for action. “What does this warning light mean?” People are automatically alerted when specific scenarios are detected. The characteristics and failure modes of an asset will be known, so when partnered with condition monitoring pending failure can be detected and people warned. Depending on how sophisticated a piece of equipment is, this may be a single error or warning light or a detailed fault code which accurately indentifies the issue. e. g. car running in “limp mode” until it’s taken to the garage Prescriptive maintenance: Recommended action provided. “The freezer says it needs defrosting” Users receive specific recommended actions to prevent failure. So rather than a description of the problem, they are given information about the action they need to take to avoid a failure. No time is needed to fault-find or diagnose problems, as the piece of equipment states exacty what is required to address the situation. This also reduces the skill and expertise personnel need to be able to operate and maintain the asset. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) may provide this functionality for ‘user serviceable’ equipment, but ensure that more complicated or costly fixes e. g. dashboard: check tyre pressures Reliability-centered maintenance: Identifying the best maintenance approach for each asset. “We can’t suffer a failure” Past breakdowns are analysed to identify the best maintenance approach for each item of equipment, based on it’s historic and/or anticipated reliability. In this instance an assets performance and reliability inform the most appropriate maintenance regime. New equipment will be maintained largely in line with the manufacturers recommendations. Then more weight given to historical records of condition and failure rate as the equipment ages. Like risk-based maintenance, when implemented properly this method is labour intensive, requiring knowledge of an assets’ failure modes. e. g. establishing the safe minimum level of maintenance for an aircraft "

    "body": "2020/10/07 - May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess. Garry Kasparov, chess grandmaster and world-champion at the time, was beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue 2. 5 - 3. 5 in a 6 match tournament. Popular attention subsequently moved to Go, where humans still had the edge. It took until March of 2016 before Google’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4 - 1. Since, it has been largely accepted that computers can out-compete humans when it comes to strategy board games. However after Kasparov’s defeat in 1997, he championed ‘freestyle chess’, to see how far technology could push the level of chess being played by teams made up of anyone or anything. As freestyle tournaments became more common something very interesting happened. Centaurs - humans using readily available chess software and off-the-shelf laptops - were able to win against the most advanced artificial intelligence running on supercomputers. There’s more: the best centaurs weren’t grandmasters, but amateur chess players with backgrounds such as gaming and programming. So what does this tell us? In freestyle chess you don’t have to be a grandmaster to beat the best AI. In fact being a grandmaster doesn’t improve your chances as much as being familiar with computers. People who train themselves using YouTube can now finish DIY projects with a level of quality previously only achieved by professionals who know the ‘trade secrets’. Companies are increasingly focused on retaining organisational knowledge in their processes and systems, reducing the impact of staff turnover. In fact the latest ISO 9001 quality standard is now explicit about this (clause 7. 1. 6 if you’ve got a copy). To me the future looks like it belongs to those who, like centaurs, know how to best use technology. Not those who’ve amassed the most knowledge. In which case the highest performing businesses will be those who’ve invested in their systems, processes and technology - and focused on making them easy for people to use. "

    "body": "2020/03/06 - It sounds like madness, but I believe many manufacturers are doing just this. Imagine you've bought a new car but the dashboard was an optional extra, you spent the money on metallic paint instead. . . .  Operating a factory without knowing the status and health of critical equipment is equivalent to driving a car without knowing the oil temperature or how much fuel is in the tank. Things are fine just now, and might be until you visit a garage. . . but Sod's law suggests a failure won't come just before the planned outage, but when the plant is under pressure to meet an important deadline.  Crazier, but no less common, is the purchase of expensive technology then a failure to integrate it with existing systems. I liken this to buying a retro-fit speedometer then allowing the mechanic to install it outside (it's cheaper and easier this way, try to imagine the project has already overspent and overrun. . . . ). Now every journey involves slowing, winding down the window to stick your head out - whenever you want to check how far you've come or how fast you're going! Surely paying staff to walk around a site to monitor or control equipment locally is just as inconvenient? Finally, alarms and alerts. Without lights to warn of impending problems, your new car will quickly depreciate in value and lose performance as faults go unnoticed causing lasting damage. I for one am always a little nervous of any taxi driver that can ignore multiple warnings from the dashboard, but at least they haven't taped over the lamps! I see operators of everything from printing presses to power stations with no central display for alarms and warnings. Witnessing alarms being ignored (because they've been there so long) or instruments looped out (because they aren't reliable) frequently.  So, have I made fair comparisons? Is your organisation driving blind? p. s. if you're interested in the top photo, it's Juuso Pykälistö (FIN) in the 2003 Swedish Rally, not driving blind, but pushing his Peugeot 206 WRC to its limits.

Last week, what should have been an easy journey of just 8km turned into a saga lasting several hours thanks to missed buses and failed connections. I’d literally have been better off walking! Repeating the experience in (yet) another place made me think. . . it’s not the main journey, but the much shorter transfer that often causes problems. The same is true when it comes to transferring data.

So asking yourself or someone else to make a serious decision, with information that is presented poorly, not current or even relevant, isn't a good idea. However many control system users are doing this everyday by using poorly designed or maintained Human Machine Interfaces (HMI). The purpose of a HMI is to provide information to system users, allowing them to make decisions. However, good HMI design takes time, time that is often 'saved' when projects are delivered. This leaves a legacy of control systems with terrible user interfaces, which at best waste time and energy, but at worst represent a significant risk to plant personnel and equipment. A good opportunity to improve displays comes when systems are upgraded. Unfortunately there is often the same pressure to save time and money, along with reluctance from system users to make changes to interfaces they are familiar with. This is unfortunate, as good HMI design can reduce load on users while improving their effectiveness. Often the time delay between an undesirable event occurring and a remedial action being taken is significant, wasting resources and impacting profitability.

If you are still using RS3 you've likely benefitted from many years of trouble-free service from a system that doesn't need a lot of routine maintenance. For this reason the justification for putting off migration to a newer control system has been easy. Emerson Automation Solutions withdrew on-demand support for the RS3 DCS in October 2013. Since then Emerson has only offered factory support to users of this legacy system via it's 'Sustain Program' intended to migrate users onto it's DeltaV platform. You may be one of those still running RS3 equipment because it has proved hugely reliable and the cost of replacement or migration is prohibitively expensive. Op-tec Systems has supported customers with RS3 equipment for over 20 years. For some of our clients RS3 remains their main DCS, others have gradually de-commissioned it as they have migrated to up-to-date PLC-SCADA or DCS solutions. The reasons for replacing RS3 tend to focus on HMI components. Thirty years of use takes its toll on keyboards and trackballs and failures start to occur. Op-tec have some ingenious solutions to these challenges, and have given aging systems a new lease of life, restoring performance to ‘as new’.  &nbsp; The RS3 DCS comprises:  Operator Consoles (HMI)  ControlFiles, with associated Card Cages (holding I/O modules)  Interfaces to external systemsThese components communicate via a redundant PeerWay communications highway. RS3 is capable of controlling continuous and batch processes, via Rosemount Basic Language (RBL) programming and later ABC Batch Studio. Because of the proprietary nature of RS3 there are limited ways to integrate it efficiently with modern systems. Emerson can offer migration to their latest technology incrementally, while other major vendors tend to recommend an 'all or nothing' rip and replace approach. We can help plan a RS3 replacement, by reverse engineering the programming of your current system, evaluating your needs and likely future requirements and supplying a lifecycle management plan for a phased, incremental migration; or FEED study if you have already decided to replace your system in one go. Our reverse engineering services save significant amounts of redesign and specification work. While you continue to run RS3 equipment we can provide service support, giving you the reassurance of having engineering expertise available as and when you need it. Our development systems are also available to test spares and validate backup files.

They were critical components in the motor-starting protection system. The boards themselves were simple enough, just four digital inputs, some pre-defined set-points, relay logic and timers as the processing functions, and four digital outputs. The problem was that they were discontinued over a decade ago. Two options presented: The first would be to allow the failure to force the change and replace the old but still serviceable refrigeration system in its entirety. This would involve a prolonged shutdown, a crane lift, and huge loss of revenue during the several weeks procurement process of new equipment. The second would be replacement of the failed component; a temporary repair that allowed the revenue stream to continue while preparations were made for a planned and controlled permanent repair with minimal loss of revenue. After a lengthy search the answer was clearly 'no longer available' and getting replacements manufactured would be a protracted and costly process. Thinking laterally, a small PLC with four digital inputs and four digital outputs would fulfil all of the engineering requirements. Overkill? Maybe, but the resulting solution cost less than the last control board purchased as a spare, takes up less space in the panel, is available from stock, and can be programmed to fulfil a variety of roles.

    "body": "2019/07/16 - Virtualisation (or virtualization to the rest of the world) is widespread within IT and quickly being adopted for OT systems. The technology has proven reliable and brings significant benefits. Control system server virtualisation reduces the number of physical servers required and provides greater control over how services are managed and run. For systems with a large number of servers there are also significant cost savings available. The move to virtualised servers requires additional hypervisor software and specialist hardware to 'host' the 'guest' operating systems (OS) and applications. A proportion of the hosts' computing resources are allocated to each guest OS using virtual hardware. It is the cost of the hypervisor software and higher specification server hardware that makes virtualisation expensive for small numbers of guest OSs. You may already have virtualised servers as part of your control system architecture, or even use the technology along with thin clients to replace 'traditional' operator workstations. But those yet to implement the technology often question whether the added complexity is worth it.  Kwesterh, via Wikimedia Commons If you are in this position, I suggest evaluating the pro's and con's below, then consider whether virtual machines (VM) are a good fit for your organisation:   How many machines would you virtualise?  Do you have staff with the necessary skills and expertise?  Are your current systems maintained in-house or by a third party?  Do you have any serial, or other legacy, interfaces?  Will the time savings and performance benefits offset the cost?Advantages:   Reduces power consumption and cabinet space required  Allows centralised management  Support for different/legacy operating systems  Ease of backup and restore  Allows centralised management  Disconnection between hardware and software  Improved reliability and availability  Users lack direct access to hardware  Load balancing and hardware optimisation  Reduce time to create isolated test/development environments (sandboxes)  Facilitates upgrade and migration projectsDisadvantages:   Compatibility with legacy communication protocols  Users lack direct access to hardware  Additional 'layer of complexity'  Extra cost of hypervisor softwareThe lists above are not meant to be comprehensive, more an executive summary to provide a starting point. Every organisation will have different requirements and existing practices which will determine whether VMs are the best solution.

You could put it off until it breaks and forces the issue with unplanned downtime. Then you find there isn’t a spare in stores, the part is on a six week lead time, and the board will want an explanation why production is being hit. You could implement a rigorous maintenance schedule so that nothing ever gets close to wearing out, and the board will ask why so much money is being spent on spares stockholding and plant upkeep. Or you could watch, and wait, gathering data to predict when wear is becoming critical and failure is approaching, but is not imminent. Data acquisition from modern CNC machines is easy with IIoT connectivity already integrated, but a fifty year old lathe, milling machine or packaging line should not be ruled out. Current transformers on the power supply, temperature probes and vibration detectors on a tool carrier, motor speed and torque measurement on a conveyor, connected to an I/O outstation enable communication with ‘mature’ equipment.

We believe basing your control architecture on open technology gives numerous benefits, and makes keeping pace with technological developments easier and cheaper. In this post I'll be explaining what is meant by open technology, and begin to discuss how you make the most of it. First off, I'm not suggesting open source software for industrial automation. Certainly if you follow the path of 'openness' far enough you may end up considering one of the many open source SCADA packages available. However the ease of use, availability of support, and known lifecycle of solutions developed by established vendors is generally worth paying for. - and yes, I know Tux represents Linux and not open source software generally, but it's a cute thumbnail By open technology, I mean equipment compatible with communications protocols based on open standards. Open standards are publicly available and so supported by a large number of vendors. Examples include OPC UA, CAN bus, PROFINET and Modbus, there are many more.  Rogeriofox [CC BY-SA 4. 0], via Wikimedia Commons For decades many industry sectors were tied into proprietary DCS solutions. These had advantages: stability, reliability, and a known lifecycle; providing robust control over large complex processes. Nearly all DCS products offered similar functionality and capabilities, however due to the closed nature of the technology end users had to return to the original vendor for subsequent upgrades and modifications. The alternative was to  rip and replace , a huge endeavour requiring significant cost and disruption. With the development of PLC and SCADA technologies and widespread use of Ethernet-based networks, much, if not all the functionality of a DCS can be provided with equipment from a variety of vendors. An approach using open technology and standardised communication conventions removes reliance on a single vendor, allowing purchasing decisions to be more strategic or on a purely commercial basis. A mix and match approach won't be best for everyone. Some will prefer a single supplier to provide one point of contact for accountability reasons. Others will see benefit in reducing the number of spares needed or breadth of expertise required in the maintenance team. In any case I would encourage you to specify open technology where practical, to retain the option of changing supplier without needing to rip and replace. Bear in mind that it is highly likely you have a mix of technology already, for example packaged equipment containing PLCs or reporting packages gathering plant data. How integrated are these systems with the main DCS/SCADA? "

In any plant there will be diverse control platforms operating well, but in isolation from each other. Each one holds data about its own part of the process, information that is valuable for predicting maintenance requirements, reducing the risk of unplanned shutdowns, and is probably used in management reports. Open technology is the key in the ignition, drive your data to where it can be used to best advantage. Op-tec stands for open technology, which we use wherever possible to capture data from control and automation equipment and platforms.  Use of modern, open protocols avoids tying you to any single supplier. We’ve used the principle in applications from sub-sea through manufacturing plant and into space. It is adaptable, reliable, and maintainable. Process requirements may change leaving a legacy of un-necessary software still running and consuming resources. The data network in a manufacturing environment is hardly ever installed with future expansion in mind and as more traffic is added speed suffers. We can reduce the burden by removing the ‘chaff’ in a control program so that better performance can be obtained with zero capital expenditure. Identify operating behavioural patterns leading up to a critical failure and so prevent recurrence. “It just stopped” is not what any production manager wants to hear. We can gather and historise operational data so that characteristics preceding a failure may be recognised in future reducing unplanned shutdowns and associated downtime. Automate the population of management reports. Having staff take readings from displays on the production line and manually transferring them into reports is time-consuming and often creates errors. We map process data to the correct fields in management reports instantly and accurately. Saving so much time and energy at work means you can go to the gym on the way home!But it’s not compulsory. "

But installed plant automation has a finite life which needs to be extended for as long as possible to maximise the viability of the process, and the business. Facts &amp; Options: Neglected controls suffers more downtime than maintained, is prone to cascade failures, and costs more to restore to full functionality. Maintained systems runs reliably, forecasting becomes more accurate and the business can plan with confidence. Neglected plant costs more in lost production time and poor quality-control, with product value being lost having to sell rejects at reduced price. Maintained equipment has a longer life than that subject to neglect, but even the best becomes outmoded and reaches the end of its viability. A contingency plan should be in place for its succession. Operating systems are not perfect when they are released, there will be upgrades throughout their lifespan. Software is not perfect when it is installed, modifications will be made during commissioning and operational life. Changes to product specification or production technique will force program revision, to maintain best efficiency. Power cuts, voltage surges and lightning strikes can occur. A disaster recovery plan mitigates their impact. The diligent plant manager not only strives to maximise product quality and output, but also to minimise rejects, downtime and cost of repairs. Mechanical plant maintenance is good but on its own is not enough. A comprehensive regime including controls and automation is key. Option 1: Do nothing Adopt a reactive policy.

Definitions: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is use of Internet of Things technologies in manufacturing. Simply, it is the use of 'smart' devices which can exchange data in industrial environments. Advances in technology mean large amounts of data can be passed, easily and securely, using IP-based (Internet Protocol) networks. The increasing number of devices able to transmit useful information is one trend driving Industry 4. 0. The term Industry 4. 0 was originally coined by a group working on the German government’s high-tech strategy. They presented four design principles: Interoperability - connected machines, devices, sensors, and people communicating with one anotherInformation transparency - creating a virtual copy of the physical world through aggregation of raw sensor data to higher-value informationTechnical assistance - supporting informed decisions and performing tasks that are too unpleasant, exhausting, or unsafe for humansDecentralised decisions - perform tasks and make decisions autonomously, only delegating tasks to a higher level in the case of exceptionsThe term is also used to refer to the forth industrial revolution: Where is your organisation on the timeline?: To control systems engineers, much of the above should sound familiar. For decades technology has been available to extract diagnostic information, remotely calibrate instruments and control process conditions. 1986, HART (became an open standard)1996, FOUNDATION Fieldbus (first H1 specifications released)1999, PROFIBUS (specification for DP and PA first published)Further, object-orientated DCS and SCADA systems allow software models of plant equipment which provide operational, diagnostic and performance information for an asset in a single entity. So you may be further towards adopting Industry 4. 0 technologies than you think! To make the most of your current technology, and benefit from new equipment and software, determine the information you need from your systems. There are risks to implementing the latest technology with no clear objective:   Only one in five of the professionals we surveyed indicated their automation systems had delivered “all that their vendors promised. ” ARC Advisory GroupUltimately, the right information to the right person at the right time leads to better decisions and greater efficiency. Understand the objectives and desired outcomes of your project. It may be that your existing infrastructure can already provide the answers: Variable frequency drives, PLCs within 'packaged' equipment and existing fieldbus instrumentation can often provide sufficient diagnostic and performance data to make smarter decisions lot about the health of the assets they control.

    "body": "2017/08/01 - We often get asked the difference between DCS and PLC/SCADA-based systems, and where PACs come in to it. So here's an attempt to clear things up. History: DCSs (Distributed Control Systems) were originally developed to control large industrial processes and typically have a number of autonomous controllers located across a plant. With microprocessors running control algorithms in the field, central computers were left to provide the operator interface, and this proved more reliable than centralised control architectures. The control function block concept was also a key feature of early DCSs, a single entity which provided both the logic and graphical interface to control equipment. Because the two were created together, subsequent modification and expansion of the system was relatively easy. PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), on the other hand, first addressed the needs of the car manufacturers. Modular devices, that were more flexible than discrete controllers, relays and sensors, PLCs could be reprogrammed allowing assembly lines to be modified and updated without re-wiring individual devices. PLCs were also resilient to hot and dusty shop floor environments, not suitable for the digital computers of the time.  While we're at it. . . RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) are sometimes called Remote Telemetry Units due to their suitability for connecting geographically diverse pieces of equipment to a SCADA. RTUs traditionally communicated wirelessly and couldn't execute control algorithms, but are otherwise functionally similar to PLCs. SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) systems were typically networked computers providing graphical interfaces, data collection and storage facilities to a wide variety of PLCs and RTUs. SCADA solutions were first adopted where equipment was located across vast distances, for example the water, gas and electrical networks. Today: With the adoption of more 'open' communication standards, little separates modern DCS and PLC/SCADA solutions. DCSs used to be based on proprietary technology but now bear more resemblance to PLC/SCADA systems to benefit from widely available technology. Likewise, manufacturers of traditional SCADAs now make importing PLC taglists into system databases almost automatic, making configuration changes more DCS-like. PLC and RTU technology has also converged, with either able to communicate wirelessly or run control algorithms. To describe higher-spec units many vendors now use the term PAC (Programmable Automation Controller). PACs tend to have more memory, connectivity options and faster CPUs than a 'standard' PLC. So which do you need?: This will be covered in detail with another post, coming soon. "

    "body": "2017/06/02 - After many years of operating with a compliant Quality Management System, we have now committed to regular external audits against the latest standard. This gives our customers and partners further reassurance that when they work with Op-tec they work with a company focused on delivering excellence through continuous improvement. ISO 9001 was first introduced in 1987 and requires organisations to demonstrate that  they do what they say they do , a QMS ensures consistency and improvement; leading to high levels of performance and customer satisfaction. Certified organisations are committed to continuous improvement and are assessed to ensure progress is maintained. Process: Before starting to review and update our processes and documentation, we needed to appoint an auditor. Knowing that any certification gained would only be as credible as the certifying body used, we selected the British Assessment Bureau, UKAS accredited to provide QMS certification. Having the infrastructure and processes in place already meant we weren't starting from scratch and already had more than enough worked examples of our QMS in use. Updating our Quality Manual to better reflect the future needs of our customers, and bring it in line with the 2015 edition of ISO 9001 took the most effort. That said, over the course of 3 months our existing systems were bought up to date and Quality Manual (now a 'Business Management System') refined. Having prepared thoroughly, the eventual audit passed without drama, although the few days spent waiting for final confirmation of the outcome were still a little nerve-racking! Result: With our QMS certified for 3 years, we intend to display our certification with pride - although probably never this large again. This doesn't mean we intend to sit back and relax though, we are truly committed to continuous improvement and welcome any feedback from customers, past or present.  The British Assessment Bureau: The British Assessment Bureau’s reputation was established in 1969 as a specialist in certification scheme management. In 1997, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry approved the use of the word ‘British’ in their title, in recognition of their pre-eminent status. Today, they certify organisations to recognised standards, including ISO 9001 (quality management), ISO 14001 (environmental management), ISO 27001 (information security management) and OHSAS 18001 (occupational health and safety management). They also design and manage bespoke assessment schemes. Such schemes are based on the establishment of standards, which can be developed to be recognised company-wide, industry-wide, nationally, or internationally.

    "body": "2017/04/12 - We all have a favourite t-shirt, sweater, pair of jeans or trainers that have stood the test of time - in our own eyes at least. Comfortable, dependable and reliable, we only feel compelled to replace these items when they finally fall apart in the wash, or someone close to us takes drastic action and disposes of them on our behalf.  Lachlan Hardy, Flickr If it ain't broke. . . : But when it comes to technology, the mantra  if it ain't broke, don't fix it  no longer seems to apply. The decision to replace something no longer feels like ours to make: smartphone, tablet or laptop not compatible with the latest operating system? You  need  to upgrade before the risks of running unsupported software become too great, or to access the latest applications and features. A fear of falling behind, too often justifies an upgrade we could have put off. My new jeans never seem to offer more features than my last.  Those able to resist the urge to upgrade seem to be rewarded, a better model offering more for less emerges a few months later to the frustration of those who couldn't wait. In the meantime, the world didn't end because their activity tracker was a little more chunky, their phone couldn't record HD video, or smartwatch needlessly replicate every annoying Facebook notification (just me?). . . . don't panic!: Whether you're at the cutting edge, or manage with last years model at home; the latest technology is a luxury many working on established process and manufacturing sites can only dream of. When it comes to ageing control systems different rules apply, upgrades are costly and come with a fair degree of risk. That said, having given good service over the years, so-called legacy systems become increasingly difficult to maintain: OEMs increasingly struggle to offer the level of service required as experienced engineers retireSpares are getting expensive, and suffer from extended lead timesReporting and monitoring requirements bring pressure to connect systems to enterprise networks, further exposing them to security threatsYour current vendor may offer a migration path to their latest system, and the justification is probably there. But is this the best option for your site? Would you like to evaluate the alternative options? We can help: Having worked with many of the major DCS, PLC and SCADA systems, both old and new, Op-tec will give you impartial advice. If required, we can reverse engineer your existing system to produce a requirement specification for a current generation system. However in many cases it is possible to prolong the life of existing technology, and plan the phased replacement or upgrade of existing systems over time, scheduling work during routine shutdowns. As an independent service provider it is not in our interests to recommend expensive solutions where not required, or 'make things easy' with an initially attractive rip-and-replace strategy that risks disrupting ongoing production.
