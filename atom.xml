After the immediate explosion, oil continued leaking from the well at a rate of up to 60,000 barrels a day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company based in Aberdeen, Scotland, has developed an ingenious solution for blowout prevention in collaboration with Op-tec Systems that involves repurposing electric motors and drivetrain technology similar to carmaker Tesla’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We were contracted by a large oil and gas company in the USA to build a blowout prevention application for offshore drilling and extraction operations,” says Ben Bamford, founder and CEO of Quantum Leap Technologies (QL Tech). “They were looking for new ideas of how to control that equipment and to ensure a high level of assurance that the issues were being addressed.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thinking-laterally&quot;&gt;Thinking laterally&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional way of preventing, managing or suppressing a blowout or similar emergency is to use huge, gas-filled bottles to push liquid out at high pressure. QL Tech and Op-tec came up with something rather different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We took the heart of a Tesla Model S car: the battery, inverter and motor. Instead of putting wheels on it, we attached a pump to the electric motor,” Ben says. “Our solution, which provides hydraulic fluid to operate the safety equipment, is powered from a battery system and can accelerate output equivalent to doing 0 to 60 mph in a few seconds. We were integrating advanced technology that has recently come to the fore and been qualified for electric car applications. The engineering challenge was to demonstrate that the system can be used robustly for a safety application.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battery power is maintained by trickle-feed of electricity so that it is always ready to be deployed, with zero notice. The whole system had to be made sufficiently robust to withstand the harsh environment at a marine depth of 3,000 metres, including ultra-high pressure, currents, temperature and the corrosive influence of saltwater, and to do so in an emergency where time was critical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-project-put-into-practice-ideas-and-objectives-that-op-tec-and-ql-tech-have-in-common&quot;&gt;The project put into practice ideas and objectives that Op-tec and QL Tech have in common.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Op-tec helped us with PLC (programmable logic control) and software elements. Richard (Banyard) and I are kindred spirits, in feeling there is so much more that can be done with low-cost hardware, the application of a bit more machine intelligence and a bit more focus on integrating with existing systems,” Ben explains. “Some of the new pieces of technology and commoditised software building blocks are really changing the game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QL Tech has three operating divisions: Integrated Power Solutions, which provides class-leading battery, inverter and control systems; 57 Degrees, which develops and delivers intelligent robotics for industrial applications; and Leap Automation, which provides accessible, affordable automation services to the manufacturing sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unusually for the automation sector, it is a vertically-integrated company. It designs and builds its own robot arms and tools, as well as working with specialist collaborators and partners, like Op-tec. It has a novel approach to the application of artificial intelligence, as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dont-over-engineer-solutions-that-arent-needed&quot;&gt;Don’t over-engineer solutions that aren’t needed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Building a robot arm is easier and cheaper than it has ever been before and we have found that, in many applications, artificial intelligence-driven robots don’t need the same level of precision of conventional robots,” Ben explains. It’s quite a bold assertion when precision for many automated tasks is essential. “Some robots are being sold to food and drink companies, for example, that are over -engineered, in our view. Very much more basic systems can provide tremendous amounts of value. By engineering solutions that are specific to the customers we can make the economics work and hit economies of scale much sooner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben mentioned a brewery that had examined a machine to automate the sorting and packing of cans. QL Tech suggested a solution that, instead of being absolutely precise, was ‘good enough’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our solution was much simpler mechanically but much more complex from a software perspective,” he continues. “The artificial intelligence we are using and the vision system we have built-in allows the robot to interpret the world around it. We don’t need the cans to be in exactly the right spot; it just needs to be in the right area and the robot will pick and pack it successfully.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QL Tech is bringing similar thinking to a solution for painting undersea pipe and pumping applications, and to systems for detecting faults in food processing lines, such as spotting and removing defective bread rolls. Quantum Leap Technologies believes so strongly in its approach to business that it allows customers to rent a solution and to try before buying, which helps reduce risk and make automation more available for SMEs.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a number of technologies in the heat transfer, energy storage and electricity supply industries that need to be integrated, and done successfully, the whole will be greater than the sum of the parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to add light as well as heat to the discussion we must consider the heat pump paradox: When you need it most it gives you least. And to make sure it gives you enough in the worst case scenario, you have to over-size it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst case scenario would be an air source heat pump operating in the depths of winter. Being expected to produce viable domestic hot water and heat a dwelling simultaneously  really is scraping the bottom of the cost-efficiency barrel and should be considered as the desperate last resort. It will work, but  the plant will be uneconomically oversized, it will be working at the limits of its envelope, there will be frequent periods without heat due to defrosts, efficiency will be at its lowest and the demand for, and hence the price of, electricity will be at its highest. This is what the heat-pump user remembers long after the glossy advertising brochures have been recycled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The air-source heat pump needs some help. Consider adding alternative resources, such as a borehole to transfer heat from deep beneath the ground. If the ground can offer a higher grade source of heat than ambient air, then it would make sense to use that as the preferred heat source. The challenge then is that as surely as digging coal out, or pumping oil out of the ground, the energy source viability will be depleted gradually unless you have the luxury of local volcanic activity, which can bring its own problems. You still have the issue of high electricity price, but the plant could be more economically sized, and efficiency for at least the first year will far exceed what air source could achieve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summer, domestic hot water is the dominant but lesser heating demand, air temperature is high, sun is shining on the photo-voltaic panels, fresh breezes are spinning the turbines, and on the smart grid electricity demand and hence the price, is low.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the heat pump paradox: When you need it least it gives you most. And if a heat pump is sized for winter operation then it will give you far more than you actually need in summer. The excess capacity can be used to replace the heat extracted from the ground during winter whilst providing the benefit of comfort cooling, and this can be done while electricity is plentiful and cheap and the air heat source is good, so the ground can now used as an efficient heat sink to store cheap energy when the heat pump efficiency and cost-effectiveness is at its best. Summer is the perfect opportunity to deposit heat into the energy bank surrounding the borehole, for use later, in winter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dual source, dual sink heat pump technology is well proven in hundreds of commercial and retail premises throughout the land, and the principles hold good to fulfil a domestic role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smart Grid technology is also well proven and can feed electricity price and availability data into controllers equipped with the intelligence to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowledge is having information. Wisdom is knowing how to use knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logical steps would be the combination of the air source heat pump with its ground resource counterpart, capitalising on the best efficiencies at the best times as identified by smart grid pricing, to maximise heat transfer and minimise expenditure on electricity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integrating an intelligent controller that can measure and record the heat transfer from air-resource to load, or air-resource to ground-resource, or ground-resource to load, and learn to optimise the energy usage, would enable selection of the most appropriate operating mode to maximise the overall annual efficiency of not merely an intelligent heat pump installation, but wise heat pump operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Peter Jackson</name><email>peter.jackson@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">There is much debate on the efficacy of heat pumps for domestic heating, but heat pumps alone are not the answer.

To help clients avoid them I’ve written a lot about the common problems I see and how to overcome them. The blog post is the first of many which aim to share this knowledge with a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;productisation&quot;&gt;Productisation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many products, services and ‘solutions’ offered by consultancies and vendors aren’t designed to address the needs of the end-user. Instead they are designed to be easy to sell repeatably, and generate opportunities for recurring revenue. This isn’t a problem in itself, in terms of technology it would be cost prohibitive to engineer solutions to every problem from first principles. But it does mean the components of every project or service are ‘productised’ to some degree and systems sold on the merits of these products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conflicts of interest arise when the end-user/purchaser hasn’t been able to translate their long-term strategic objectives into the functional requirements. These don’t just help determine the most suitable solutions from the marketplace but also the true measures of success.
When purchasing, engineering or project management decisions aren’t based on strategic objectives. Not being able to relate products to the benefits they deliver can lead to undesirable outcomes…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is you if the sales presentation ‘chimed’ - the solution discussed delivered the key objectives your management team laid out in their strategy meeting – but the final solution failed to live up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your procurement function may have focused on costs rather than benefits. If so, they will have pushed the supplier to reduce cost, meaning the add-on components needed to deliver the key benefits were removed from the scope of supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was your supplier’s own engineering team. A common situation is the solution ‘sold’ is uncomfortable for engineers to deliver, due to its complexity or novelty. They may not have experience working with ‘products’ proposed, so don’t get the best out of them. They may be uncertain the resulting solution would meet more basic criteria such as availability and reliability so remove ‘bells and whistles’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another group who could be responsible are project managers on either side. They may not be properly incentivised to deliver strategic objectives. Or could see hitting budget or timing expectations as more important measures of success. In which case they’re likely to unknowingly compromise the return a project delivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the cause, a lack of clear communication of, and focus on, the benefits to be delivered and why they are so important to achieve can result in a project’s value not being fully realised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fixing-scope&quot;&gt;Fixing scope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way focus shifts to costs and deadlines, is when a project’s scope is fixed prematurely. Yes, late changes cost more to make than they would if they were picked up earlier in the project…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, suppliers never have the time and resources to fully engineer a solution during the bid and proposal stage. Likely similarities with past projects were used to quickly create a specification and price, then this work ‘tweaked’ to meet any unique requirements. Internal Sales Engineers have a significant influence on the design, but they tend to be generalists rather than subject matter experts. It’s only a good way into the project when people with specialist knowledge of the technology have taken every requirement into account (as they finish design work and you move to the build phase).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now ask yourself if it’s sensible to the fix the scope at the beginning of the project, before subject matter experts have been given time to fully evaluate the requirements and complete the detailed design. Doing so risks missing out of the knowledge and expertise they bring to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, making changes during the second half of this process is more costly. That’s why any changes proposed must be carefully scrutinised against the strategic objectives of the project. Assuming the original scope will achieve the outcomes you desire, regardless of any new knowledge acquired by subject matter experts, is very dangerous. It can easily lead to change requests being evaluated with a focus on cost and time, with benefits the project is meant to deliver taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;integration&quot;&gt;Integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology projects are a focused period of activity, they typically involve working with suppliers, maybe also advisors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties. As such they are often thought of as a standalone activity, executed alongside operations then delivered and completed.
This is a trap, which many organisations who fail to properly integrate new technology fall into. The organisation isn’t aligned with the technology, so can’t use it to best effect and so expected returns aren’t realised. In a future article I’ll discuss this in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

It is the UK’s leading producer of acetate esters and aroma chemicals; its products are used in cosmetics, metalworking fluids, paper, plastics, oilfield exploration, pharmaceuticals and other applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Our processes are largely but not fully automated,” says Phil Malpas BEng (Hons), Electrical Controls and Instrumentation Engineer with Tennants. “Some plants are more automated than others. We have a centralised &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/control-system-types&quot; title=&quot;Distributed Control System&quot;&gt;DCS&lt;/a&gt; and separate &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/control-system-types&quot; title=&quot;Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition&quot;&gt;SCADA&lt;/a&gt; system.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;aligning-automated-and-manual-systems&quot;&gt;Aligning automated and manual systems&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DCS and SCADA are not always found in the same production environment. Here, the DCS is process-oriented, tightly controlling each step of an operation. While the SCADA is focused on acquisition and collation of the data operations personnel use to make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“When we run batch sequencing, for example, we can make the systems pretty automated. The chemicals will run through a system on their own, with limited operator input,” Phil says. “We use the DCS to ensure the system is being controlled or processes within the normal design operating window. A vessel’s pressure might be between 0 - 1 bar, for example; if you have over pressure, you might have a data concern. Where we have a pressure transmitter and monitor, the basic logic system will provide an alert to a “door open” event, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/control-system-types&quot; title=&quot;Programmable Logic Controller&quot;&gt;PLC&lt;/a&gt; is used to sequence control in a certain order and to maintain it in a safe way. Automation of data input reduces the risk of human error and helps prevent hazardous issues arising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;partners-in-time&quot;&gt;Partners in time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op-tec Systems has played an important role in the process of automation and upgrade at Tennants for nearly 20 years. It has helped the company to upgrade its hardware and software to the latest versions, clean up and document signal databases and system architecture. All of which has helped resolve several issues of monitoring and management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have installed new thermal, process and remote controllers. It has enabled improved visibility of the entire plant,” says Chemical Engineer Martin Higgs, based at the company’s Staffordshire facility. “Op-tec were instrumental in helping us to diagnose problems and create fixes. Since then, everything has been working fine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-long-term-partnership&quot;&gt;A long-term partnership&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important further improvement was the installation of a remote control system in a hazardous area at Tennants several years ago, also implemented by Op-tec.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Richard Banyard of Op-tec is an independent expert and has assisted with developing our system and maintaining the backroom DCS, providing technical assistance and support,” Phil explains. “He has also been assisting us with aspects of control such as cyber security.” And now Tennants has automated its processes further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We moved away from the manual intervention and operation of valves and pumps and put their operation onto the DCS, a huge step forward for us,” says Martin Higgs. “This meant that the plant could be controlled mostly from the control room. A few years ago, we converted two of our oldest plants and put them onto the DCS as well. In terms of efficiency, this is a major benefit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Op-tec has also helped train Martin and colleagues to become more self-sufficient, and understand then resolve control system issues. In the future, Op-tec will support with system upgrades and extending automation further. The process of doing so will, inevitably, raise some issues. Manufacturers like Tennants appreciate improvement can be disruptive; examining and changing long-established practices can be uncomfortable but they are necessary in order to retain or regain competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to a successful transformation is to have a partner who understands what has already been achieved and what is being sought, and can help to map, plan and guide the company on the journey.&lt;/p&gt;

It may never be possible to eliminate the risk of an unplanned shutdown entirely, but smart use of plant data can significantly reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re sick of praying for things to keep working until the end of the day / week / month / year, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are simple explanations of common maintenance approaches. If you’re new to the concept of data-informed maintenance, know there are companies out there already pushing far beyond these techniques. For example, using machine learning to identify external factors such as weather patterns or employee behaviour to better inform predictions. Or allowing their systems to automatically order spare parts and schedule preventative work before human operators have the chance to notice anything’s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely you’ll say to yourself “we already do this” as you read through. If so, ask whether your existing processes are as effective as they could be. We see people manually undertaking this work &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, storing records on paper or retrieving it from ‘offline’ equipment only to import it into another system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So read on, then ask: ‘Could my organisation improve it’s maintenance regimes?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corrective-maintenance&quot;&gt;Corrective maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait until something breaks, then take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it requires doing nothing this is often seen as the most cost-effective option. Only true if the cost of downtime, in-house expertise, and spare parts is less than those associated with a data-driven approach if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If equipment in question is critical to operations rapid repair or replacement will be necessary to minimise disruption. Also referred to as reactive maintenance. This approach risks significant costs should catastrophic failure occur, where repair or replacement is not possible within a defined timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No data is needed for this approach. Information available is often used to diagnose the cause of failures after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. replacing a blown bulb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Preventive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervene before failure becomes likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When was the cambelt last changed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance activities are performed before they’re required; typically at predetermined intervals based on historical records or manufacturer recommendations. Sometimes referred to as ‘proactive maintenance’ this technique allows work to be carried out during planned shutdowns minimising disruption. Taking this approach means performing maintenance before it’s needed, so the assumption is the resource needed to do this if cheaper than implementing a more data-driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique can be improved over time by using measurement, analysis and periodic testing to better inform service intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. changing car engine oil every 10,000 miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Risk-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the impact into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get that boiler serviced before winter”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect a failure will have on operations and it’s likelihood is used to allocate available resource efficiently. The condition of assets will also be monitored to ensure changing risks, as equipment and machinery ages, is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantity and quality of data used can vary widely, from the objective analysis of an employee to automated anaylsis of assets over time. It may also be useful to consider factors other than just equipment condition, such as market demand or stock levels.  Information gathered can also inform the schedule for replacing or upgrading equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. waiting until a shutdown to install software updates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;condition-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Condition-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor ‘health’ for warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No signs of wear…“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance work is informed through performance monitoring of equipment. Typically, key parameters are recorded over time, and trends which indicate pending failure identified. Manual inspection during outages can also be used to determine when work needs to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated systems record device parameters over time. Maintenance is required when values deviate from ‘normal’ indicating the probability of a failure has increased to an unacceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. a motor drawing more current than usual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific thresholds for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What does this warning light mean?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are automatically alerted when specific scenarios are detected. The characteristics and failure modes of an asset will be known, so when partnered with condition monitoring pending failure can be detected and people warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how sophisticated a piece of equipment is, this may be a single error or warning light or a detailed fault code which accurately indentifies the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. car running in “limp mode” until it’s taken to the garage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prescriptive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Prescriptive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended action provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The freezer says it needs defrosting”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users receive specific recommended actions to prevent failure. So rather than a description of the problem, they are given information about the action they need to take to avoid a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No time is needed to fault-find or diagnose problems, as the piece of equipment states exacty what is required to address the situation. This also reduces the skill and expertise personnel need to be able to operate and maintain the asset. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) may provide this functionality for ‘user serviceable’ equipment, but ensure that more complicated or costly fixes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. dashboard: check tyre pressures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliability-centered-maintenance&quot;&gt;Reliability-centered maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the best maintenance approach for each asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We can’t suffer a failure”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past breakdowns are analysed to identify the best maintenance approach for each item of equipment, based on it’s historic and/or anticipated reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this instance an assets performance and reliability inform the most appropriate maintenance regime. New equipment will be maintained largely in line with the manufacturers recommendations. Then more weight given to historical records of condition and failure rate as the equipment ages. Like risk-based maintenance, when implemented properly this method is labour intensive, requiring knowledge of an assets’ failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it’s negligible, or an afterthought when improvements aren’t realised, how do things look now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate engineer I was baffled when my old employer moved to a newer version of Windows. They put on a huge number of training courses offering staff the chance to learn the new features available in the operating system and Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it looked like a huge waste of time and money. Surely everyone has a computer at home? Surely people keep up with current technology and ways of working in their own time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, some do. Most don’t. Looking back, I’ve no doubt the training was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m still doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had formal training on MS Windows or Office. I’m eternally grateful when someone shows me a useful feature I didn’t know about. I’ve even been known to say “How am I only finding out about this now, this is going to save me loads of time….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll ask you again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?" /><published>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur">&lt;p&gt;May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess. Garry Kasparov, chess grandmaster and world-champion at the time, was beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue 2.5 - 3.5 in a 6 match tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular attention subsequently moved to Go, where humans still had the edge. It took until March of 2016 before Google’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4 - 1. Since, it has been largely accepted that computers can out-compete humans when it comes to strategy board games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after Kasparov’s defeat in 1997, he championed ‘freestyle chess’, to see how far technology could push the level of chess being played by teams made up of anyone or anything. As freestyle tournaments became more common something very interesting happened. Centaurs - humans using readily available chess software and off-the-shelf laptops - were able to win against the most advanced artificial intelligence running on supercomputers. There’s more: the best centaurs weren’t grandmasters, but amateur chess players with backgrounds such as gaming and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In freestyle chess you don’t have to be a grandmaster to beat the best AI. In fact being a grandmaster doesn’t improve your chances as much as being familiar with computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who train themselves using YouTube can now finish DIY projects with a level of quality previously only achieved by professionals who know the ‘trade secrets’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are increasingly focused on retaining organisational knowledge in their processes and systems, reducing the impact of staff turnover. In fact the latest ISO 9001 quality standard is now explicit about this (clause 7.1.6 if you’ve got a copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me the future looks like it belongs to those who, like centaurs, know how to best use technology. Not those who’ve amassed the most knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which case the highest performing businesses will be those who’ve invested in their systems, processes and technology - and focused on making them easy for people to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess.
