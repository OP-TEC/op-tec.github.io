Manufacturers who implement a unified namespace build networks in a hub and spoke layout providing all major systems a direct link to the unified namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unified namespace, or central repository, is the hub of an organisation’s networks. It features details of every data point in the organisation and all information passses through it. Software providing this service is commonly referred to as a ‘data broker’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/unified-namespace.png&quot; alt=&quot;Network overview - unified namespace&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Network architectures which utilise a unified namespace don’t conform to the traditional Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, the standard model for company networks since the 1990’s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of this approach relies on lighteight ‘report by exception’ communication protocols (e.g. MQTT). This ensures the data broker(s) which making up the unified namespace can handle the huge amount of data flowing through them and minimises loading on ‘satellite’ systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced system and network complexity&lt;/strong&gt; – Maximum of 2 connections between any two systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalable architecture which supports digitalisation&lt;/strong&gt;  – Minimises cost of future modification, expansion or integration. Reduces cost of experimentation, proof of concepts and improvements projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lower integration costs&lt;/strong&gt; – Addition of new systems or data points simplied with changes only required to a single connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supports OT/IT convergence&lt;/strong&gt; – Having a centralised and shared resource necessitates teams responsible for operational and information technology to work effectively together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Removes need for system knowledge&lt;/strong&gt; – Object-orientated/contextualised approach allows creation of digital twins. Enables people with little or even no knowledge of operational technology will be able to navigate and use data from the UNS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Standard presentation for data from different providers&lt;/strong&gt; – Plant or equipment with the same functions from different suppliers can be presented in a uniform and consistent manner.&lt;/p&gt;

Just as I was about to set up and leave Sally informed me she had a bit of an engineering task she believed I would be able to fix. Sure, I affirmed because I am always down for a challenge, only for her to inform me her shower soap holder had broken, and she had a new part to fix it. However, she didn’t know how to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was expecting a challenging task. Nevertheless, I was challenged as it turns out she had ordered a very beautiful soap holder, but the fitting system was made for shower poles with a 25mm pole diameter and hers was 22mm. The challenge was explaining that while good, her solution wouldn’t work with the wrong parameters. I called two days later to check up, she had the right one and could fix it up herself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar events happen within our niche. A few days back, I went down south to a client site to commission equipment they had designed to dry their product quicker. My role was to ensure the equipment they had set up would perform the task efficiently. The equipment consisted of blowers blowing air through air knives and a chain conveyor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supposed to be a straightforward task, right? That was my thought process until I interacted with the equipment. On my first run with the damp product, I realized parts of the product were dry and other parts were not. A simple solution adjusts the air knife position parameter to effectively dry the remaining part of the product. As simple as it sounds, it went from being simple to being manually demanding as the designers of the equipment had not created room for parameter adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The good news is we got the desired result after manually modifying the equipment. However, the equipment needs to be shipped back and modified to accommodate optimizable adjustment hence some cost on someone’s side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do a non-fitting shower soap holder and non-adjustable drying equipment have to do with me you may wonder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment in both cases didn’t meet expectations because crucial questions, were answered correctly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) What is the problem we want to overcome?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) What parameters directly affect the problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) How does each parameter impact the problem?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost all of us are spot on with the first question. However, when it comes to the second and third, most of us are found wanting. Sally, my friend, was spot on with the first question. 
However, she didn’t understand the parameters that would be used to implement the solution (question 2) and couldn’t go further to answering question 3. With my friends down south, you can see that questions 1 and 2 were answered. However, question 3 was left out so the solution parameters couldn’t be modified to meet their expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In providing solutions for your project, you need to understand the parameters that &lt;strong&gt;Op&lt;/strong&gt;enly relate to your solution and the &lt;strong&gt;tec&lt;/strong&gt;nologies behind these parameters. That way you would be closer to implementing your solution as “plug and play”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Obiefuna Obidike</name><email>obiefuna.obidike@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="chemicals" /><category term="power" /><summary type="html">I went to visit Sally down at Sale the other day, we had a good conversation over a “cuppa tea”.

What is the value of validating your control system or process historian? Many industries don’t bother and leave it to the domain of the regulated manufacturers such as the Pharmaceuticals, Aerospace and Nuclear industries as it is often considered to be a very time consuming and expensive process which offers little in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But could other industries such as food, textiles, paper, oil and gas etc benefit from this approach? I would say definitely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s true to say that, initially at least, computer system validation will add work-load to a project while staff come to terms with the process. However, the benefits thereon are manyfold – not least that you will end up with a properly documented system built to the relevant standards which you can then use to fault find and diagnose faults or manufacturing issues and when upgrading or changing the system. The validation process also leaves a documentation chain newcomers can use to understand how the software system works so it can be effectively and efficiently supported and modified in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many times have you heard, &lt;em&gt;“I don’t know how it works – Joe wrote the software originally and he’s the only one who understands it”&lt;/em&gt;. Never helpful, especially if Joe left the company 18 months ago!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also has the benefit of making you think during the design process as validating a system does not only involve the prospective design of a computer system but also as to whether it will work by virtue of a comprehensive testing regime. In this sense it is often argued that both design and test processes should be run in parallel – in other words when you design a piece of software have you considered whether you can you test it? If the answer to this is no, then you will struggle to get the software to work in the first place! In fact if you can’t test it you can’t be sure it works!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is Computer System Validation? The text book definition is ‘the process of ensuring a software system meets specifications and requirements so it fulfils its intended purpose’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a computer system validation conference years ago and heard this definition for Computer System Validation, which I prefer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say what you are going to do&lt;/strong&gt; – Write the relevant specifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do what you said you would do&lt;/strong&gt; – Build the system according to the specifications you’ve written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prove you did what you said you would do&lt;/strong&gt; – Test the system according to the specifications you’ve written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For help getting started with computer system validation I recommend taking a look at the ISPE’s (International Society of Pharmaceutical Engineering) excellent publication called GAMP5 (Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) which explains this recognised methodology for computer system validation. It also provides a comprehensive list of documentation type templates (e.g. URS, FDS etc).&lt;/p&gt;

They all have engine management lights showing. The trouble is, the engine management light doesn’t tell you what the actual fault is – it’s just a warning to tell you something’s up. To help understand the problem you need to interrogate the car’s control system, known as the ECU (Engine Control Unit) by reading the fault codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing I could buy a code scanner to help decipher the conditions behind these fault codes I bought one and began looking into the cause of the errors on cars which were otherwise running just fine!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the process I picked up a little of the jargon in the code scanner world. A few key terms follow, to demystify this area of vehicle ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OBD-II&lt;/strong&gt; - On Board Diagnostics 2. A standard pretty much all cars now follow as it was made mandatory for all cars manufactured in the US since 1996.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIL&lt;/strong&gt; - Malfunction Indicator Lamp. The scary yellow light (or sometimes orange or red light depending on the severity of the fault) which appears on the dashboard as an engine symbol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DTC&lt;/strong&gt; - Diagnostic Trouble Code. Alphanumeric codes OBD-II scanners display once plugged in and connected to your vehicle. They are split into 4 categories (Power, Chassis, Body and User Network) followed by a number of digits further describing the fault (e.g. P0215).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting: although OBD-II is a standard it isn’t necessarily the end of the story. Many car manufacturers add functionality into their diagnostic systems in addition to the standard OBD-II facilities available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you use an OBD-II Scanner? Simply plug it into the OBD connector, normally found somewhere behind the trim  on the driver’s side by the dashboard, and it should spring into life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My scanner is a very simple one (it cost me £36 from Amazon). It starts reading data immediately it is plugged into the car, presenting a menu from where I can interrogate the car’s status. Even the simplest scanners will enable you to read fault codes and reset them and also show live engine data such as engine speeds, mass air flow etc. More expensive units show graphs of live data too. The most expensive scanners allow you to manipulate the cars settings, termed bidirectional control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first tried the scanner on my daughter’s car, the photo below shows the code displayed. I quickly worked out why they are called “codes”! ‘Mass or Volume Air Flow A Circuit Range/Performance – Air Flow too Low’ didn’t really tell me exactly what was wrong. It did point us in the right direction though. On further examination the fault was found to be a blocked pipe which cost £26.00 to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/OBD-II_scanner_output.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Output from an OBD-II scanner&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect you’re hoping for a punchline to this article. Well in my mind its what you can come to understand by using diagnostic systems and how they can save you money. It’s interesting to observe the motor industry providing advanced diagnostic systems to consumers, while many manufacturers supplying the very same industry remain reluctant to adopt similar technology. Systems such as &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/control-system-types&quot;&gt;SCADAs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/knowledge/process-historians&quot;&gt;Process Historians&lt;/a&gt; can be used to diagnose faults and better understand how to run a plant at maximum efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my punchline (or moral to the story) is to advocate you implement a diagnosis system to drive (pun intended) process optimisation in your company. Get past measuring success by not breaking down and move to being able to predict failures and tune the performance of your equipment. Develop a diagnostic system which provides a clear visualisation of everything happening in your plant. Then alerts you when something needs attention and how to correct it - before it goes wrong!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Halliwell</name><email>roger.halliwell@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="chemicals" /><category term="power" /><summary type="html">We have four cars in our household and three of them are more than 10 years old.

This ensures it is both safe and not hurling huge levels of emissions into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only there was a mandate for businesses to carry out similar testing of their manufacturing processes. Not only from an emissions and safety point of view, but also from an efficiency standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a manufacturing facility here in the UK and was amazed at the levels of waste that could easily be overcome by deploying standard automation technology. We surveyed the site in terms of wasted energy, damaged product, manual operations and wasted time, finding and reporting many instances of waste. We also determined that for a small investment (under £50k) the payback period for improvements would be less than 13 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know waste is often categorised in Lean Manufacturing in terms of the following 7 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Transport&lt;/strong&gt; - unnecessary transportation of goods before they reach the manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Inventory&lt;/strong&gt; - where too high stock levels waste working capital&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Movement&lt;/strong&gt; - unnecessary movement of goods within the manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Time&lt;/strong&gt; - delays waiting for partly finished goods or raw materials&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Defects&lt;/strong&gt; - goods being either thrown away or reworked due to quality issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Overprocessing&lt;/strong&gt; - goods worked for too long or produced at too high a specification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Overproduction&lt;/strong&gt; - the manufacture of too many goods compared to demand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to add a further category: wasted talent – i.e., we often don’t get the most out of our staff either because they are overlooked, not inspired or not involved in the management side of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we spend a little time considering the above we could improve our businesses, make them more profitable, enjoyable to work in, kinder to the planet - and in this current economic climate - more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Halliwell</name><email>roger.halliwell@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="chemicals" /><summary type="html">It’s a statutory requirement that once your car is over 3 years old it be MOT’d every year.

&lt;p&gt;How can I say this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently discovered many espresso machines offer an abundance of monitoring, analytics and automation to local businesses who are keener than ever to increase their efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most cafés coffee is the bread winner. A reputation for great coffee attracts new customers and ensures they keep coming back. So brewing coffee (known as extraction in the espresso world) at an optimum yield and quality is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern espresso machines monitor production to make sure the perfect amount of coffee and the brew time are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consistency of the ground coffee is a key variable. Coarser grounds allow water to pass through quicker than finer grounds which have a longer brew time. Knowing the perfect brewing time (say 27s, +/- 1s) machines can alert baristas to the need to adjust the grinder to produce a coarser or finer grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again at the image above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of espresso shots is monitored along with the performance of individual group heads so variability can be reduced. Daily counts of perfect brews Vs imperfect ones also provide a metric equivalent to the coffee machine’s OEE (&lt;a href=&quot;/tools/OEE-get-started&quot;&gt;Operational Equipment Effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cafés also use EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) systems to enable customers to undertake cashless transactions. These can connect to accounting and inventory management software enabling automated stock control based on the ingredients used for specific recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you visit or pass a coffee shop consider whether your company could better employ technology to maximise yield and maintain high quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question I get asked frequently. While discussing anything from PLCs to process historians - so many devices and machines are capable of logging historical data these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently faced with the challenge of deciding how much operational data to collect: think about your car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard should be clear, concise and not cluttered with unnecessary information. Everything needed to drive on a daily basis is available, data points you don’t need to worry about aren’t displayed. Maybe it looks something like the one above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the dashboard embedded computers will be monitoring and recording a vast amount of data while you drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proves useful for maintenance, servicing and when something goes wrong. Much time and money can be saved in the diagnosis of a problem if historical events and system generated messages are available which explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakdowns and expensive repairs can also be avoided by monitoring component characteristics which indicate wear before consumable parts fail. You will then be prompted to take action avoiding damage to more expensive components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apply this thinking to your plant or factory by classifying your data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KPIs&lt;/strong&gt; - What are your key performance indicators? Which data points are needed to calculate them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily operation&lt;/strong&gt; - Information operational staff need to do their job, monitor performance and identify opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; - Data, when analysed through time, provides information on the performance and condition of your assets and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; - Error and warning messages, process conditions, operator actions; these and many other data points can inform investigations when things go wrong allowing the identification of the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="power" /><category term="chemicals" /><summary type="html">“Do we really need to collect so much data?”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22There's%20more%20data%20'under%20the%20hood'%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22There's%20more%20data%20'under%20the%20hood'%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Who owns your automation software?</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who owns your automation software?" /><published>2022-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software">&lt;p&gt;The ‘rent or buy’ concept is not a new one. It’s the difference between buying software on a perpetual or subscription basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perpetual license&lt;/strong&gt; - Pay once, to use the software for as long as you wish. Ongoing updates and support will be an ‘optional extra’ or provided for a limited time from the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription license&lt;/strong&gt; - Regularly pay a recurring fee for access to the software. Product updates and support costs are bundled into the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a wider trend towards subscription and ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) products; when you buy industrial automation software you can still choose the licensing model which best suits your needs. Where you may get less choice however, is whether you actually own the software which runs your plant at all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to highlight several characteristics of automation software which everyone who buys it needs to be aware of. Buying automation software without this understanding can turn out to be an expensive mistake. One that’s easy to make, and even large blue-chip companies get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this equips you to ask the right questions when engaging automation suppliers. Helping you buy &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/open-technology&quot;&gt;open technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;putting you in control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automation-software&quot;&gt;Automation software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it’s important to understand the components of automation software, as the language used by vendors isn’t always clear. Broadly industrial automation software can be categoriesd in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt; - The ‘system’ is the software package created by (typically) a large automation manufacturer. It’s the software environment your vendor uses to configure the equipment they are supplying so it operates your plant correctly. The ‘system’ can be likened to your computers’ operating system, except in most cases it’s tied to the hardware being used so is more like macOS than Windows or Linux. For example, you must use a Siemens &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industry-software/automation-software/tia-portal.html&quot;&gt;TIA Portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industry-software/automation-software/tia-portal/software/step7-tia-portal.html[&quot;&gt;STEP 7&lt;/a&gt; system to configure a Siemens PLC; likewise Rockwell’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-gb/products/software/factorytalk/designsuite/studio-5000.html&quot;&gt;Studio 5000&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-gb/capabilities/industrial-automation-control/design-and-configuration-software.html&quot;&gt;Connected Components Workbench&lt;/a&gt; is needed to configure it’s Allen-Bradley PLCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt; - Using the ‘system’ your vendor will create a Project containing the software configuration used for programming the automation equipment to control your plant and machinery. The ‘configuration’ is the source code discussed below, and can also be referred to as the application, logic, project or config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this distinction clear, read on to learn about the methods automation vendors use to keep ownership of software in order to secure the loyalty of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-have-you-bought&quot;&gt;What have you bought?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently received an enquiry from one of our clients - a multinational, publicly listed enterprise. Several of their sites had used a systems integrator to upgrade their &lt;a href=&quot;/knowledge/process-historians&quot;&gt;process historians&lt;/a&gt;. The contracts looked good value at the time, pricing was competitve and included a comprehensive support agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years on, things looked a little different. The process historians were not being backed up or maintained. On looking into changing suppliers our client discovered system software licenses they thought were purchased in their name had in fact been leased to them by the systems integrator. Meaning the cost of changing to another supplier, even the software manufacturer, would include paying for the software again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enquiry? Could we help upgrade the process historians, and move them onto new licenses they’d purchased to exit the supplier relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When buying control systems with a software component ensure your automation vendor buys the software in your name, not theirs. This does not prevent the vendor from providing you with support, but ensures the software manufacturer has your details on file as the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you change vendors in the future, or decide to ‘self-maintain’, you retain ownership of the software and access to manufacturer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wheres-the-source-code&quot;&gt;Where’s the source code?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More common when buying a pre-built machine, but not unknown in distributed control systems, is the practice of vendors keeping ownership of &lt;a href=&quot;/knowledge/using-programmable-logic-controllers&quot;&gt;PLC&lt;/a&gt; ‘source code’. This is the program which tells a machine’s embedded controller how to operate the equipment and communicate with other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of machinery, the manufacturer has invested significantly in developing their product and likely doesn’t want their know-how falling into the wrong hands. Also, their business is better equipped than others to provide follow on service and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-term this situation can hurt end-users, when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The original equipment manaufacturer (OEM) decides to withdraw support for the product line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over time the OEM loses the experts who originally designed and manufactured the machine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OEM goes out of business, or otherwise, can’t meet its obligations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control of source code is used to prevent the end-user going elsewhere for related systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PLC within the machine fails, and they are reliant on the OEM to fix it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For process control systems, where PLC software has been written specifically for the end-user in line with their requirements, there’s no justification for withholding access to source code. If IP must be protected this can be done to specific code blocks (see below), rather than the entire configuration and holding the end user to ransom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensure you have a copy of the source code for every PLC you own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do not accept arguments your supplier may give about protecting their IP. If they need to protect know-how this can be done as described below while allowing you to have a copy for disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ip-protected-software&quot;&gt;IP-protected software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of almost all the systems used to configure PLCs have is the ability to password protect the software components. This feature is often referred to as IP or know-how protection and allows automation vendors to protect software they develop from being copied or used without their knowledge. Vendors often develop clever solutions to industry specific problems or applications, investing time which they may only be able to recover by selling the resulting product more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this feature can also be used to completely remove the ability of end-users to view and modify the software they’ve paid to develop and are reliant on to run their plant. Meaning the original supplier must be used for all future support, modifications and updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ask whether any of the configuration developed for your project will be IP-protected, and for documentation which describes what this does to allow future modifications, additions or upgrades of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a software configuration is developed against detailed requirements you’ve supplied it’s your IP, not your suppliers. They may implement specific code blocks they own to increase project efficiency and quality but how the plant works and should be controlled is your company’s know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

Then make this available either through a variety of visualisation tools such as dashboards, reports and interactive displays, or by allowing third party software access to the data they hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally used by operational personal to optimise production, and maintenance teams to analyse then predict equipment failures. Increasingly process historians are integrated into business systems giving data analysts operational and commercial information. This makes process historians a core component of digital transformation as companies move towards data-driven decision making and automation of business processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most process historians make use of proprietary database technology. Performance, security and resilience are typically the reasons given. In practice this is fine as they provide connectivity via commonly used open protocols, for communicating to both plant-level operational equipment and business systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To collect data from plant-level Operational Technology (OT) process historians make use of open industrialised protocols like OPC and MQTT, as well as being compatible with proprietary communications utilised by specialised or legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process information is made available to Information Technology (IT) via application programming interfaces, accessed using methods such as SQL, OData and ODBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic records for regulatory compliance&lt;/strong&gt; – Digital records reduce stationary, storage and retrival costs, increase staff efficiency and speed up responsiveness to information requests and audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gateway between OT and IT networks&lt;/strong&gt;  – Located between operational and information networks process historians ensure the business has constant access to plant information without exposing more vulnerable industrial equipment to the security risks associated with systems connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise-wide data architecture&lt;/strong&gt; – Local process historians can report data to a central system giving HQ the information needed to make decisions while reducing the reporting overhead across the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable proactive and predictive maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; – Knowledge of the conditions which led to an undesirable process event mean these can be predicted, even avoided, in future. Monitor for similar situations then alert personnel or take automatic preventative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery and replication of best practice&lt;/strong&gt; – Conversely, desirable conditions can be discovered then replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

Manufacturing businesses can be particularly affected, especially those put off by the capital intensive nature of many energy saving projects. However there are many ways to reduce energy costs, some of which require minimal or no investment in infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-processes-and-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Processes and Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Audit/Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; – engage independent expertise to audit your plant and develop a prioritised and costed plan of short and long term actions to incorporate into capital and operational budgets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplier(s)&lt;/strong&gt; – consider alternative energy suppliers, and review contracts at least annually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; – cost effective energy monitoring devices are now widely available, and can often be integrated into existing control, automation or even business systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Switching&lt;/strong&gt; – build energy saving measures into existing operating procedures as widely as possible, from office computers to larger plant items.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Control&lt;/strong&gt; – from PIR sensors on lights to powering off equipment when not required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimising Control&lt;/strong&gt; – running equipment at the precise output needed, rather than simply switching it on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Motors&lt;/strong&gt; – list all electric motors in use and determine whether cost-benefit to replacing each with a more efficient model, either immediately or when they are due to be replaced (rather than rewinding or repairing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Shedding&lt;/strong&gt; – use real-time data to automatically switch off plant or equipment to follow a desired energy consumption profile so defined energy consumption levels are not exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical Supply&lt;/strong&gt; – voltage reduction, power factor correction and reducing electrical noise can lower energy costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Generation&lt;/strong&gt; – gain control over your own energy supply or even go as far as generating additional revenue by exporting any excess to the grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving on energy consumption not only increases profitability by directly reducing input costs. It also improves environmental performance, an important consideration for the increasing number of businesses reporting their greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimising energy use can also improve product quality, workforce safety and identify process optimisation opportunities. Further, with equipment duty reduced, savings can be made in the costs of servicing, maintenance and consumables.&lt;/p&gt;

Manufacturing businesses can be particularly affected, especially those put off by the capital intensive nature of many energy saving projects. However there are many ways to reduce energy costs, some of which require minimal or no investment in infrastructure.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867-small.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867-small.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22Could%20your%20energy%20consumption%20be%20reduced?%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867-small.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867-small.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22pexels-francesco-ungaro-5017867.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22Could%20your%20energy%20consumption%20be%20reduced?%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
