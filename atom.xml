This ensures it is both safe and not hurling huge levels of emissions into the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If only there was a mandate for businesses to carry out similar testing of their manufacturing processes. Not only from an emissions and safety point of view, but also from an efficiency standpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently visited a manufacturing facility here in the UK and was amazed at the levels of waste that could easily be overcome by deploying standard automation technology. We surveyed the site in terms of wasted energy, damaged product, manual operations and wasted time, finding and reporting many instances of waste. We also determined that for a small investment (under £50k) the payback period for improvements would be less than 13 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may know waste is often categorised in Lean Manufacturing in terms of the following 7 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) Transport&lt;/strong&gt; - unnecessary transportation of goods before they reach the manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Inventory&lt;/strong&gt; - where too high stock levels waste working capital&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Movement&lt;/strong&gt; - unnecessary movement of goods within the manufacturing facility&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Time&lt;/strong&gt; - delays waiting for partly finished goods or raw materials&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) Defects&lt;/strong&gt; - goods being either thrown away or reworked due to quality issues&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) Overprocessing&lt;/strong&gt; - goods worked for too long or produced at too high a specification&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Overproduction&lt;/strong&gt; - the manufacture of too many goods compared to demand&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d also like to add a further category: wasted talent – i.e., we often don’t get the most out of our staff either because they are overlooked, not inspired or not involved in the management side of the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps if we spend a little time considering the above we could improve our businesses, make them more profitable, enjoyable to work in, kinder to the planet - and in this current economic climate - more sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Roger Halliwell</name><email>roger.halliwell@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="chemicals" /><summary type="html">It’s a statutory requirement that once your car is over 3 years old it be MOT’d every year.

&lt;p&gt;How can I say this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently discovered many espresso machines offer an abundance of monitoring, analytics and automation to local businesses who are keener than ever to increase their efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most cafés coffee is the bread winner. A reputation for great coffee attracts new customers and ensures they keep coming back. So brewing coffee (known as extraction in the espresso world) at an optimum yield and quality is vitally important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern espresso machines monitor production to make sure the perfect amount of coffee and the brew time are used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consistency of the ground coffee is a key variable. Coarser grounds allow water to pass through quicker than finer grounds which have a longer brew time. Knowing the perfect brewing time (say 27s, +/- 1s) machines can alert baristas to the need to adjust the grinder to produce a coarser or finer grade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look again at the image above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of espresso shots is monitored along with the performance of individual group heads so variability can be reduced. Daily counts of perfect brews Vs imperfect ones also provide a metric equivalent to the coffee machine’s OEE (&lt;a href=&quot;/tools/OEE-get-started&quot;&gt;Operational Equipment Effectiveness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cafés also use EPOS (Electronic Point of Sale) systems to enable customers to undertake cashless transactions. These can connect to accounting and inventory management software enabling automated stock control based on the ingredients used for specific recipes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So next time you visit or pass a coffee shop consider whether your company could better employ technology to maximise yield and maintain high quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A question I get asked frequently. While discussing anything from PLCs to process historians - so many devices and machines are capable of logging historical data these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently faced with the challenge of deciding how much operational data to collect: think about your car.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dashboard should be clear, concise and not cluttered with unnecessary information. Everything needed to drive on a daily basis is available, data points you don’t need to worry about aren’t displayed. Maybe it looks something like the one above?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind the dashboard embedded computers will be monitoring and recording a vast amount of data while you drive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This proves useful for maintenance, servicing and when something goes wrong. Much time and money can be saved in the diagnosis of a problem if historical events and system generated messages are available which explain what happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breakdowns and expensive repairs can also be avoided by monitoring component characteristics which indicate wear before consumable parts fail. You will then be prompted to take action avoiding damage to more expensive components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now apply this thinking to your plant or factory by classifying your data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KPIs&lt;/strong&gt; - What are your key performance indicators? Which data points are needed to calculate them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily operation&lt;/strong&gt; - Information operational staff need to do their job, monitor performance and identify opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; - Data, when analysed through time, provides information on the performance and condition of your assets and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostics&lt;/strong&gt; - Error and warning messages, process conditions, operator actions; these and many other data points can inform investigations when things go wrong allowing the identification of the root cause.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><category term="software" /><category term="food&amp;drink" /><category term="textiles" /><category term="power" /><category term="chemicals" /><summary type="html">“Do we really need to collect so much data?”</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22There's%20more%20data%20'under%20the%20hood'%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash-thumbnail.jpg%22,%20%22feature%22=%3E%22dennis-eusebio-MbiSXN8u8q4-unsplash.jpg%22,%20%22credit%22=%3E%22There's%20more%20data%20'under%20the%20hood'%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Who owns your automation software?</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who owns your automation software?" /><published>2022-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-06-13T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/who-owns-your-automation-software">&lt;p&gt;The ‘rent or buy’ concept is not a new one. It’s the difference between buying software on a perpetual or subscription basis:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perpetual license&lt;/strong&gt; - Pay once, to use the software for as long as you wish. Ongoing updates and support will be an ‘optional extra’ or provided for a limited time from the date of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subscription license&lt;/strong&gt; - Regularly pay a recurring fee for access to the software. Product updates and support costs are bundled into the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a wider trend towards subscription and ‘Software as a Service’ (SaaS) products; when you buy industrial automation software you can still choose the licensing model which best suits your needs. Where you may get less choice however, is whether you actually own the software which runs your plant at all…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I want to highlight several characteristics of automation software which everyone who buys it needs to be aware of. Buying automation software without this understanding can turn out to be an expensive mistake. One that’s easy to make, and even large blue-chip companies get it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this equips you to ask the right questions when engaging automation suppliers. Helping you buy &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/open-technology&quot;&gt;open technology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;putting you in control&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;automation-software&quot;&gt;Automation software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First it’s important to understand the components of automation software, as the language used by vendors isn’t always clear. Broadly industrial automation software can be categoriesd in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt; - The ‘system’ is the software package created by (typically) a large automation manufacturer. It’s the software environment your vendor uses to configure the equipment they are supplying so it operates your plant correctly. The ‘system’ can be likened to your computers’ operating system, except in most cases it’s tied to the hardware being used so is more like macOS than Windows or Linux. For example, you must use a Siemens &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industry-software/automation-software/tia-portal.html&quot;&gt;TIA Portal&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://new.siemens.com/global/en/products/automation/industry-software/automation-software/tia-portal/software/step7-tia-portal.html[&quot;&gt;STEP 7&lt;/a&gt; system to configure a Siemens PLC; likewise Rockwell’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-gb/products/software/factorytalk/designsuite/studio-5000.html&quot;&gt;Studio 5000&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rockwellautomation.com/en-gb/capabilities/industrial-automation-control/design-and-configuration-software.html&quot;&gt;Connected Components Workbench&lt;/a&gt; is needed to configure it’s Allen-Bradley PLCs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt; - Using the ‘system’ your vendor will create a Project containing the software configuration used for programming the automation equipment to control your plant and machinery. The ‘configuration’ is the source code discussed below, and can also be referred to as the application, logic, project or config.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this distinction clear, read on to learn about the methods automation vendors use to keep ownership of software in order to secure the loyalty of their customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-have-you-bought&quot;&gt;What have you bought?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recently received an enquiry from one of our clients - a multinational, publicly listed enterprise. Several of their sites had used a systems integrator to upgrade their &lt;a href=&quot;/knowledge/process-historians&quot;&gt;process historians&lt;/a&gt;. The contracts looked good value at the time, pricing was competitve and included a comprehensive support agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years on, things looked a little different. The process historians were not being backed up or maintained. On looking into changing suppliers our client discovered system software licenses they thought were purchased in their name had in fact been leased to them by the systems integrator. Meaning the cost of changing to another supplier, even the software manufacturer, would include paying for the software again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enquiry? Could we help upgrade the process historians, and move them onto new licenses they’d purchased to exit the supplier relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When buying control systems with a software component ensure your automation vendor buys the software in your name, not theirs. This does not prevent the vendor from providing you with support, but ensures the software manufacturer has your details on file as the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether you change vendors in the future, or decide to ‘self-maintain’, you retain ownership of the software and access to manufacturer support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;wheres-the-source-code&quot;&gt;Where’s the source code?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More common when buying a pre-built machine, but not unknown in distributed control systems, is the practice of vendors keeping ownership of &lt;a href=&quot;/knowledge/using-programmable-logic-controllers&quot;&gt;PLC&lt;/a&gt; ‘source code’. This is the program which tells a machine’s embedded controller how to operate the equipment and communicate with other systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of machinery, the manufacturer has invested significantly in developing their product and likely doesn’t want their know-how falling into the wrong hands. Also, their business is better equipped than others to provide follow on service and support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Longer-term this situation can hurt end-users, when:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The original equipment manaufacturer (OEM) decides to withdraw support for the product line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over time the OEM loses the experts who originally designed and manufactured the machine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OEM goes out of business, or otherwise, can’t meet its obligations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Control of source code is used to prevent the end-user going elsewhere for related systems&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The PLC within the machine fails, and they are reliant on the OEM to fix it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For process control systems, where PLC software has been written specifically for the end-user in line with their requirements, there’s no justification for withholding access to source code. If IP must be protected this can be done to specific code blocks (see below), rather than the entire configuration and holding the end user to ransom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ensure you have a copy of the source code for every PLC you own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Do not accept arguments your supplier may give about protecting their IP. If they need to protect know-how this can be done as described below while allowing you to have a copy for disaster recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;ip-protected-software&quot;&gt;IP-protected software&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A feature of almost all the systems used to configure PLCs have is the ability to password protect the software components. This feature is often referred to as IP or know-how protection and allows automation vendors to protect software they develop from being copied or used without their knowledge. Vendors often develop clever solutions to industry specific problems or applications, investing time which they may only be able to recover by selling the resulting product more than once.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However this feature can also be used to completely remove the ability of end-users to view and modify the software they’ve paid to develop and are reliant on to run their plant. Meaning the original supplier must be used for all future support, modifications and updates&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Ask whether any of the configuration developed for your project will be IP-protected, and for documentation which describes what this does to allow future modifications, additions or upgrades of the software.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;If a software configuration is developed against detailed requirements you’ve supplied it’s your IP, not your suppliers. They may implement specific code blocks they own to increase project efficiency and quality but how the plant works and should be controlled is your company’s know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

Then make this available either through a variety of visualisation tools such as dashboards, reports and interactive displays, or by allowing third party software access to the data they hold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally used by operational personal to optimise production, and maintenance teams to analyse then predict equipment failures. Increasingly process historians are integrated into business systems giving data analysts operational and commercial information. This makes process historians a core component of digital transformation as companies move towards data-driven decision making and automation of business processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most process historians make use of proprietary database technology. Performance, security and resilience are typically the reasons given. In practice this is fine as they provide connectivity via commonly used open protocols, for communicating to both plant-level operational equipment and business systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To collect data from plant-level Operational Technology (OT) process historians make use of open industrialised protocols like OPC and MQTT, as well as being compatible with proprietary communications utilised by specialised or legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Process information is made available to Information Technology (IT) via application programming interfaces, accessed using methods such as SQL, OData and ODBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electronic records for regulatory compliance&lt;/strong&gt; – Digital records reduce stationary, storage and retrival costs, increase staff efficiency and speed up responsiveness to information requests and audits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gateway between OT and IT networks&lt;/strong&gt;  – Located between operational and information networks process historians ensure the business has constant access to plant information without exposing more vulnerable industrial equipment to the security risks associated with systems connected to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enterprise-wide data architecture&lt;/strong&gt; – Local process historians can report data to a central system giving HQ the information needed to make decisions while reducing the reporting overhead across the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enable proactive and predictive maintenance&lt;/strong&gt; – Knowledge of the conditions which led to an undesirable process event mean these can be predicted, even avoided, in future. Monitor for similar situations then alert personnel or take automatic preventative action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discovery and replication of best practice&lt;/strong&gt; – Conversely, desirable conditions can be discovered then replicated.&lt;/p&gt;

Manufacturing businesses can be particularly affected, especially those put off by the capital intensive nature of many energy saving projects. However there are many ways to reduce energy costs, some of which require minimal or no investment in infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-processes-and-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Processes and Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Audit/Strategy&lt;/strong&gt; – engage independent expertise to audit your plant and develop a prioritised and costed plan of short and long term actions to incorporate into capital and operational budgets.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supplier(s)&lt;/strong&gt; – consider alternative energy suppliers, and review contracts at least annually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt; – cost effective energy monitoring devices are now widely available, and can often be integrated into existing control, automation or even business systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual Switching&lt;/strong&gt; – build energy saving measures into existing operating procedures as widely as possible, from office computers to larger plant items.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic Control&lt;/strong&gt; – from PIR sensors on lights to powering off equipment when not required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimising Control&lt;/strong&gt; – running equipment at the precise output needed, rather than simply switching it on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Motors&lt;/strong&gt; – list all electric motors in use and determine whether cost-benefit to replacing each with a more efficient model, either immediately or when they are due to be replaced (rather than rewinding or repairing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load Shedding&lt;/strong&gt; – use real-time data to automatically switch off plant or equipment to follow a desired energy consumption profile so defined energy consumption levels are not exceeded.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electrical Supply&lt;/strong&gt; – voltage reduction, power factor correction and reducing electrical noise can lower energy costs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy Generation&lt;/strong&gt; – gain control over your own energy supply or even go as far as generating additional revenue by exporting any excess to the grid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saving on energy consumption not only increases profitability by directly reducing input costs. It also improves environmental performance, an important consideration for the increasing number of businesses reporting their greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optimising energy use can also improve product quality, workforce safety and identify process optimisation opportunities. Further, with equipment duty reduced, savings can be made in the costs of servicing, maintenance and consumables.&lt;/p&gt;

This can definitely be said for automation systems!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when creating them!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Albert Einstein?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article aims to highlight the fact many automation systems were developed and installed years ago. Since, a whole series of events and changes have occurred which means investing in your automation system can bring a huge amount of value and benefit to your organisation. We’d like to highlight 5 reasons why continual investment in your automation systems is a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-productivity&quot;&gt;1.	Productivity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be the most common reason for investing in your automation system. The number of products your manufacturing facility can produce over a period of time ultimately determines your income revenue. In our experience, we can’t think of a single manufacturing plant that couldn’t be made more productive through improvements in throughput.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite frankly, there are always ways of improving productivity via automation. Areas of the plant presently manually operated can be incorporated into existing automation systems, often for very little cost, all activities could be further optimised. This is why the following sections on Obsolescence, Reliability, Efficiency and Ease of Use have such an important and inextricable effect on improving your plant’s productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-obsolescence&quot;&gt;2.	Obsolescence&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue concerns all companies, regardless of size or the industry they operate in. Obsolescence puts companies at risk in two ways: in the short, and long-term. In the short-term obsolescence means a lack of spare parts. This prevents future expansion or modification of the system and means reliance on a shrinking pool of technical specialists for maintenance and repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the long-term as assets age, they likely become less fit for purpose. Typically, older equipment will be less efficient and flexible, whilst providing less ‘feedback’ on its status preventing predictive maintenance or identification of improvement opportunities. While this longer-term risk doesn’t threaten to disrupt the business, we’ve seen it lead to “death by a thousand cuts” to product lines, plants and even entire facilities as they becomes slowly less competitive in their marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To guard against obsolescence monitor the availability and status of your systems on a regular basis (easily missed in the day to day process of keeping your plant running). Determine when upgrading the system will offer the best cost-benefit, ensuring you look at the risks involved if your system fails catastrophically in the meantime or the project doesn’t go smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-reliability&quot;&gt;3.	Reliability&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poor reliability is the bane of any production system. Wherever you sit in your organisation (e.g. CEO, Operations Manager, Engineer or Operator) you’ll be aware of the result of faults which cause equipment to fail as they damage your numbers, customer relationships or generate more work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The root causes of poor reliability often end up overlooked or ignored once things are back up and running. Treating shutdowns as a nuisance rather than something which can be prevented stores issues up for a later date. It may not be convenient to address things now, but will it really be easier in a few years’ time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this also encourages a culture of: “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!”. Taking this approach, rather than driving improvements through specific targeted and measurable criteria ultimately leads to: “if it isn’t totally broken, don’t fix it!”. Human nature then means the actual cost-benefit is never properly determined and temporary work-arounds remain in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-efficiency&quot;&gt;4.	Efficiency&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This compliments Productivity. Rather than doing more with the same, this can be seen as doing the same with less. We often see the benefits of investing to reduce ongoing personal expenditure, whether it’s a more fuel efficient vehicle, insulating the house or buying better quality items ‘built to last’. However due to a focus on short-term profits often make different decisions on behalf of our businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding capital expenditure is the most common reason given for not investing in the efficiency of production equipment. In reality it’s often easier for individuals to ‘save up’ low cost opportunities then attempt to solve as many as possible with a large project than justify each separately. This leads to numerous low cost opportunities for increasing efficiency being missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This “low hanging fruit” can range from optimising (tuning) control algorithms to improve quality, reducing raw material consumption and better machine utilisation to save energy. Further, efficiency gains are not limited to reduced consumption, they can be realised by lowering change-over times or speeding up cleaning stages. Think of inefficiency as waste of any kind, be it waste product, reworked product, systems standing idle, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;5-ease-of-use&quot;&gt;5.	Ease of Use&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there’s an easier way, people will take it. Old equipment is often seen as easier to use. This can stand in the way of new technology being adopted, or even existing systems being used if people find it easier to bypass them. Likewise, current manual operations may be simplified by automating certain activities allowing operators to focus on more valuable things - like identifying opportunities for further improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same goes for those overseeing production from a computer screen. If the information they need to make decisions is at their fingertips, displayed in an easy to read format, they’re far more likely to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We still find things such as metering readings being recorded by someone walking around the plant with a clipboard, who enters the data they’ve written down into a spreadsheet then emails it to colleagues. The data is then either visualised in a presentation, entered into an business planning system, or both. This process is labour intensive, takes skilled workers attention away from important tasks and is completely unnecessary considering the business planning software likely has the ability to accept meter readings directly. Automating data collection in this situation would make several jobs easier and allow attention to be directed to acting on the information recorded in real-time, rather than after the delay caused by manual activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this may seem an extreme example, we assure it is not. There will be similar opportunities in your workplace, and you may be surprised at what your existing systems are capable of, particularly if they were configured some time ago with your original processes in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hope this article has inspired you to look again at ways you can improve your automation systems and better use them to drive operational excellence in your company.&lt;/p&gt;

PLCs are available for installation in almost any environment. As technology has matured PLCs have become increasingly affordable and highly capable devices, able to handle discrete, continuous and batch processes in any industry application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLCs are microprocessor-based devices equipped with a variety of electrical terminals for connecting to sensors and actuators on the shop or plant floor. They read signal inputs to gain awareness of current process conditions, then based on the software program running in their processor, send output signals to control equipment they are connected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PLCs can communicate with a wide variety of devices using both ‘hard-wired’ electrical signals (4-20mA, 0-10V, 24V, …) and serial communications for equipment connected using fieldbus protocols (Modbus, Profibus, DeviceNet, …). Combined with extensive mathematical functions, high computational power, compatibility with ethernet-based protocols (OPC, MQTT, AMQP, …), and internet connectivity means modern PLC’s are able to replace PCs and servers in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/Basic-PLC-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;Basic PLC architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enables PLC’s to be used in a wide variety of applications, for instance both to control processes but also as data concentrators - collecting and pre-processing data before sending it to higher level systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small footprint and robust industrial design&lt;/strong&gt; – PLCs can be installed almost anywhere, and have low power consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modular, scalable architecture&lt;/strong&gt;  – Minimises cost of future modification, expansion or integration. Being able to function alone or connected to hundreds, even thousands of others, means PLCs are used in applications of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry standard programming languages&lt;/strong&gt; – Widescale use of the IEC 61131-3 standard for software programming makes it relatively easy for technical personnel to interpret and maintain PLC logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipped with latest ‘web’ technology&lt;/strong&gt; – Compatibility with open protocols make PLCs easy to interface with almost any system, from business systems and high-level dashboarding tools, to individual sensors on the factory floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time calculations&lt;/strong&gt; – Operational insights such as Operational Equipment Effectivenes (OEE), energy consumption or quality monitoring can be provided without exposing equipment to the internet or third-party systems.&lt;/p&gt;

The increased motor control VSDs provide can improve product quality, and reduce energy consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;key-technologies&quot;&gt;Key Technologies&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most automation vendors offer VSDs. Market leaders such as ABB and Siemens have wide product portfolios to suit the needs of every type and size of application. VSD technology is well established and involves input power (AC) is rectified and is then switched (either in single or 3 phase configurations) to supply the motor windings. This switching determines the motor frequency feeding the motor windings which in turn determines the motor speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits&quot;&gt;Benefits&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variable torque applications such as pumps and fans typically have the most scope for reducing energy consumption. In these applications more energy is required to drive increased air or fluid flow as motor speed increases. This relationship is demonstrated in the power curve for an example 50kW fan motor (shown). In many situations, motors are oversized to allow for peak demand meaning that in normal operation the motor is running at a higher speed demanded by the process. This is sometimes exacerbated by mechanical throttling of the motor with some form of restriction such as a damper or throttle valve in order to control the air or fluid flow at a fixed rate (analogous to driving your car on the motorway with one foot on the accelerator and with the other foot on the brake to control the speed). By controlling the motor to run at slower speeds and by removing any unnecessary restriction then a drastic reduction in energy consumption can be achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/motor-power-curve.png&quot; alt=&quot;Typical 50kw motor power curve&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VSDs don’t only have the advantage of being able to control motor speeds but are also able to provide other advantages such as soft starting and, if fitted with suitable filtering systems can also reduce the effects of harmonics across the electrical network. The fact VSDs can be incorporated in closed loop control systems means processes can also be optimised. Another benefit of using VSDs is the motor bearings and associated hardware is less prone to stress and is therefore far more likely to operate over extended periods and with reduced maintenance. In short there really aren’t any disadvantages to introducing VSDs to your site except perhaps the initial capital costs. However, the payback periods can easily be calculated based on the energy savings which simply depend upon the reduced duty and reduced speeds that would be implemented following installation.&lt;/p&gt;

Excitement because we always feel that something new will be better than something that is old, but concern because we always wonder whether the replacement system will meet all of our expectations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having worked in automation longer than I care to remember I’ve seen this situation countless times. Often, customers are only too keen to race ahead and get a replacement system only to suffer disappointment that the new system did not solve all their problems and deliver the improvements that they desired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why is this? Well there are a number of reasons which when you think about it are quite obvious but rarely heeded!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 1: Lack of Documentation&lt;/strong&gt; - The existing system operation was not monitored or documented on how it originally worked prior to the upgrade. This is a huge mistake because neglecting to carry out an inspection and review how the existing system operates could mean that the existing functionality is lost and this could be extremely expensive when commissioning begins. This situation arises when the system documentation is not kept up to date and often occurs when changes are made on the fly or in the heat of the moment and without the necessary change control procedures in place. So you might think that how a system operates is obvious where you simply watch it, watch the operator does and that’s it. Unfortunately, this is seldom the case. An analogy is a printed circuit board containing microprocessor chips, memory ICs, capacitors and resistors, etc. – do you think you could tell me exactly how it functions? No of course not and its similar with control systems where you really need to look under the hood to understand how the software operates – especially under fault conditions. This leads me to the next reason that is so often overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 2: Purpose&lt;/strong&gt; - What helps enormously in replacing an existing system is the unambiguous purpose. Once we understand the purpose we begin to ask all sorts of questions we must be aware of and that may well have changed since the system was initially installed such as the Environment (does the system have to be IP66 rated or ATEX rated etc) are there safety issues to consider (e.g. manual operations where operators must be safe from any moving parts?), does the system need to communicate with other parts of the company (e.g. ERP Systems, 3rd Party Equipment etc)?. Not only this but we must also understand if there are any requirements in terms of speed of operation, productivity rates etc.  Then of course the issue of functionality must be carefully documented e.g. the order of preparation in a chemicals manufacturing plant, in-flight considerations, PID control, Alarms, Interlocks and the HMI (Human Machine Interface).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 3: Cheapest Price Wins&lt;/strong&gt; - As the old saying goes ‘You get what you pay for’. In automation this is undoubtedly true and really companies should be very careful here to ensure that the system that they are getting will provide both the existing system functionality plus the new functionality required and according to current standards and regulations. Many suppliers play the game of providing a so called ‘fixed’ price for replacing an existing system only to result in a list of variations as long as your arm. To avoid this you should make sure that the existing operation is understood (getting back to Reason No 1). You can either do this yourself if you have the inhouse skills and resource or use an external control systems supplier that you can trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 4: Vendor ‘Lock In’&lt;/strong&gt; - By Vendor ‘Lock In’ we mean that you as a customer have little alternative but to report back to the initial OEM Vendor whenever you want to add, change, or upgrade your system. This situation often arises when a Vendor is supplying multiple sections of the automation stack (e.g. Control System, MES, Data Historian) and where the Vendor has chosen to use proprietary interfaces forcing you to use their systems. So be mindful of this issue and consider a system that utilises ‘Best in Class’ systems and components that interface and communicate with each other using Open standards. Furthermore, look into the concept of the Unified Name Space where additional systems can be easily added as they communicate via a common Data Pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, once you have considered the above it is worth looking into the maturity and life expectancy of prospective systems. In this respect you don’t want to invest significant investment in a system that you find is immature (and prone to faults) or at the other end of the spectrum in a system that is at the end of its development lifecycle where any future improvements or developments will not occur as the vendor is more interested in the development of new systems to sell to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
