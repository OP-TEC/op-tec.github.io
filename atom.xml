To help clients avoid them I've written a lot about the common problems I see and how to overcome them. The blog post is the first of many which aim to share this knowledge with a wider audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Productisation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Many products, services and ‘solutions’ offered by consultancies and vendors aren’t designed to address the needs of the end-user. Instead they are designed to be easy to sell repeatably, and generate opportunities for recurring revenue. This isn’t a problem in itself, in terms of technology it would be cost prohibitive to engineer solutions to every problem from first principles. But it does mean the components of every project or service are ‘productised’ to some degree and systems sold on the merits of these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Conflicts of interest arise when the end-user/purchaser hasn’t been able to translate their long-term strategic objectives into the functional requirements. These don’t just help determine the most suitable solutions from the marketplace but also the true measures of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;When purchasing, engineering or project management decisions aren’t based on strategic objectives. Not being able to relate products to the benefits they deliver can lead to undesirable outcomes…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;This is you if the sales presentation ‘chimed’ - the solution discussed delivered the key objectives your management team laid out in their strategy meeting – but the final solution failed to live up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Your procurement function may have focused on costs rather than benefits. If so, they will have pushed the supplier to reduce cost, meaning the add-on components needed to deliver the key benefits were removed from the scope of supply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Perhaps it was your supplier’s own engineering team. A common situation is the solution ‘sold’ is uncomfortable for engineers to deliver, due to its complexity or novelty. They may not have experience working with ‘products’ proposed, so don’t get the best out of them. They may be uncertain the resulting solution would meet more basic criteria such as availability and reliability so remove ‘bells and whistles’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Another group who could be responsible are project managers on either side. They may not be properly incentivised to deliver strategic objectives. Or could see hitting budget or timing expectations as more important measures of success. In which case they’re likely to unknowingly compromise the return a project delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Whatever the cause, a lack of clear communication of, and focus on, the benefits to be delivered and why they are so important to achieve can result in a project’s value not being fully realised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fixing scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Another way focus shifts to costs and deadlines, is when a project’s scope is fixed prematurely. Yes, late changes cost more to make than they would if they were picked up earlier in the project…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;But, suppliers never have the time and resources to fully engineer a solution during the bid and proposal stage. Likely similarities with past projects were used to quickly create a specification and price, then this work ‘tweaked’ to meet any unique requirements. Internal Sales Engineers have a significant influence on the design, but they tend to be generalists rather than subject matter experts. It’s only a good way into the project when people with specialist knowledge of the technology have taken every requirement into account (as they finish design work and you move to the build phase).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Now ask yourself if it’s sensible to the fix the scope at the beginning of the project, before subject matter experts have been given time to fully evaluate the requirements and complete the detailed design. Doing so risks missing out of the knowledge and expertise they bring to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Yes, making changes during the second half of this process is more costly. That’s why any changes proposed must be carefully scrutinised against the strategic objectives of the project. Assuming the original scope will achieve the outcomes you desire, regardless of any new knowledge acquired by subject matter experts, is very dangerous. It can easily lead to change requests being evaluated with a focus on cost and time, with benefits the project is meant to deliver taking a back seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Integration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Technology projects are a focused period of activity, they typically involve working with suppliers, maybe also advisors, consultants, vendors, and other third parties. As such they are often thought of as a standalone activity, executed alongside operations then delivered and completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;This is a trap, which many organisations who fail to properly integrate new technology fall into. The organisation isn’t aligned with the technology, so can’t use it to best effect and so expected returns aren’t realised. My next article will discuss this in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, when we're feeling overworked, overcommitted and overwhelmed it can be hard to prioritise things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt; - Eating well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt; - Being active &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;tab justify&quot;&gt;The same is true for cyber security.

However its power and flexibility come with a cost. It's not known as the easiest system to work with - making it hard to find quality independent support, ensure updates and backups are managed correctly, and the configuration keeps pace with changes to plant and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;If you're looking for help with 800xA you may be experiencing one or more of these challenges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Routine maintenance and updates&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  If left too long it can take days rather than minutes to recover from system failures or security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Changes and modifications&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Out of date control systems aren't fit for purpose, leading people to work around, rather than benefit from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integrating 3rd party equipment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Crucial to capture, store and analyse valuable process data but often seen as a nice to have, then never done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adding extra features and functions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Your sophisticated DCS isn't delivering the benefits promised thanks to constraints during the initial project. It now feels too hard or too expensive to add extra functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;tab&quot;&gt;Op-tec's engineers have a wealth of experience working with 800xA and offer services which complement software support you may already be getting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 800xA is the world's number one DCS based on global market share. This is based on annual reports by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.arcweb.com/&quot;&gt;ARC Advisory Group&lt;/a&gt; which for the last 20 years have found 800xA to be the most common DCS. ABB's history of acquisitions has gone a long way to securing this accolade. Many of these installations will have been originally supplied by one of the companies ABB has bought over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Taylor&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;founded 1851, acquired by Combustion Engineering in 1983&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Bailey Controls&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;founded 1916, became part of Elsag Bailey Process Automation in 1989&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Combustion Engineering&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;merger of Grieve Grate and American Stoker in 1912, acquired 1990&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Fischer &amp; Porter&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;founded 1937, acquired by Elsag Bailey Process Automation in 1994&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Elsag Bailey Process Automation&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;merger of Bailey Controls and Elsag Group in 1989, acquired 1998&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  &lt;b&gt;Alfa Laval Automation&lt;/b&gt; &lt;small&gt;merger of SattControl and Alfa Laval in 1986, acquired 1998&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It's not known as the easiest system to work with - making it hard to find quality independent support, ensure updates and backups are managed correctly, and the configuration keeps pace with changes to plant and operations. If you're looking for help with 800xA you may be experiencing one or more of these challenges: Routine maintenance and updates If left too long it can take days rather than minutes to recover from system failures or security incidents. Changes and modifications Out of date control systems aren't fit for purpose, leading people to work around, rather than benefit from them. Integrating 3rd party equipment Crucial to capture, store and analyse valuable process data but often seen as a nice to have, then never done. Adding extra features and functions Your sophisticated DCS isn't delivering the benefits promised thanks to constraints during the initial project. It now feels too hard or too expensive to add extra functions. Op-tec's engineers have a wealth of experience working with 800xA and offer services which complement software support you may already be getting. Get in touch if you'd like to learn more about how we can help reduce the cost of owning this incredibly powerful technology. &amp;nbsp; +44 161 660 4293 &amp;nbsp; projects&amp;#64;op-tec.co.uk * 800xA is the world's number one DCS based on global market share. This is based on annual reports by the ARC Advisory Group which for the last 20 years have found 800xA to be the most common DCS. ABB's history of acquisitions has gone a long way to securing this accolade. Many of these installations will have been originally supplied by one of the companies ABB has bought over the years: Taylor founded 1851, acquired by Combustion Engineering in 1983 Bailey Controls founded 1916, became part of Elsag Bailey Process Automation in 1989 Combustion Engineering merger of Grieve Grate and American Stoker in 1912, acquired 1990 Fischer &amp; Porter founded 1937, acquired by Elsag Bailey Process Automation in 1994 Elsag Bailey Process Automation merger of Bailey Controls and Elsag Group in 1989, acquired 1998 Alfa Laval Automation merger of SattControl and Alfa Laval in 1986, acquired 1998</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22engineers-using-simulator-3862149.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22engineers-using-simulator-3862149.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22engineers-using-simulator-3862149.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22engineers-using-simulator-3862149.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Using data to inform maintenance</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/knowledge/using-data-to-inform-maintenance" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Using data to inform maintenance" /><published>2020-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-11-20T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/knowledge/using-data-to-inform-maintenance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/knowledge/using-data-to-inform-maintenance">&lt;p&gt;How you use data analysis to inform maintenance activity can have a huge impact on the efficiency of your operations. It may never be possible to eliminate the risk of an unplanned shutdown entirely, but smart use of plant data can significantly reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re sick of praying for things to keep working until the end of the day / week / month / year, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are simple explanations of common maintenance approaches. If you’re new to the concept of data-informed maintenance, know there are companies out there already pushing far beyond these techniques. For example, using machine learning to identify external factors such as weather patterns or employee behaviour to better inform predictions. Or allowing their systems to automatically order spare parts and schedule preventative work before human operators have the chance to notice anything’s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely you’ll say to yourself “we already do this” as you read through. If so, ask whether your existing processes are as effective as they could be. We see people manually undertaking this work &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, storing records on paper or retrieving it from ‘offline’ equipment only to import it into another system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So read on, then ask: ‘Could my organisation improve it’s maintenance regimes?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corrective-maintenance&quot;&gt;Corrective maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait until something breaks, then take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it requires doing nothing this is often seen as the most cost-effective option. Only true if the cost of downtime, in-house expertise, and spare parts is less than those associated with a data-driven approach if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If equipment in question is critical to operations rapid repair or replacement will be necessary to minimise disruption. Also referred to as reactive maintenance. This approach risks significant costs should catastrophic failure occur, where repair or replacement is not possible within a defined timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No data is needed for this approach. Information available is often used to diagnose the cause of failures after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. replacing a blown bulb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Preventive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervene before failure becomes likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When was the cambelt last changed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance activities are performed before they’re required; typically at predetermined intervals based on historical records or manufacturer recommendations. Sometimes referred to as ‘proactive maintenance’ this technique allows work to be carried out during planned shutdowns minimising disruption. Taking this approach means performing maintenance before it’s needed, so the assumption is the resource needed to do this if cheaper than implementing a more data-driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique can be improved over time by using measurement, analysis and periodic testing to better inform service intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. changing car engine oil every 10,000 miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Risk-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the impact into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get that boiler serviced before winter”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect a failure will have on operations and it’s likelihood is used to allocate available resource efficiently. The condition of assets will also be monitored to ensure changing risks, as equipment and machinery ages, is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantity and quality of data used can vary widely, from the objective analysis of an employee to automated anaylsis of assets over time. It may also be useful to consider factors other than just equipment condition, such as market demand or stock levels.  Information gathered can also inform the schedule for replacing or upgrading equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. waiting until a shutdown to install software updates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;condition-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Condition-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor ‘health’ for warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No signs of wear…“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance work is informed through performance monitoring of equipment. Typically, key parameters are recorded over time, and trends which indicate pending failure identified. Manual inspection during outages can also be used to determine when work needs to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated systems record device parameters over time. Maintenance is required when values deviate from ‘normal’ indicating the probability of a failure has increased to an unacceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. a motor drawing more current than usual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific thresholds for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What does this warning light mean?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are automatically alerted when specific scenarios are detected. The characteristics and failure modes of an asset will be known, so when partnered with condition monitoring pending failure can be detected and people warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how sophisticated a piece of equipment is, this may be a single error or warning light or a detailed fault code which accurately indentifies the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. car running in “limp mode” until it’s taken to the garage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prescriptive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Prescriptive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended action provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The freezer says it needs defrosting”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users receive specific recommended actions to prevent failure. So rather than a description of the problem, they are given information about the action they need to take to avoid a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No time is needed to fault-find or diagnose problems, as the piece of equipment states exacty what is required to address the situation. This also reduces the skill and expertise personnel need to be able to operate and maintain the asset. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) may provide this functionality for ‘user serviceable’ equipment, but ensure that more complicated or costly fixes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. dashboard: check tyre pressures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliability-centered-maintenance&quot;&gt;Reliability-centered maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the best maintenance approach for each asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We can’t suffer a failure”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past breakdowns are analysed to identify the best maintenance approach for each item of equipment, based on it’s historic and/or anticipated reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this instance an assets performance and reliability inform the most appropriate maintenance regime. New equipment will be maintained largely in line with the manufacturers recommendations. Then more weight given to historical records of condition and failure rate as the equipment ages. Like risk-based maintenance, when implemented properly this method is labour intensive, requiring knowledge of an assets’ failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. establishing the safe minimum level of maintenance for an aircraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Projects</name><email>projects@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="knowledge" /><summary type="html">How you use data analysis to inform maintenance activity can have a huge impact on the efficiency of your operations.

&lt;p&gt;If it’s negligible, or an afterthought when improvements aren’t realised, how do things look now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate engineer I was baffled when my old employer moved to a newer version of Windows. They put on a huge number of training courses offering staff the chance to learn the new features available in the operating system and Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it looked like a huge waste of time and money. Surely everyone has a computer at home? Surely people keep up with current technology and ways of working in their own time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, some do. Most don’t. Looking back, I’ve no doubt the training was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m still doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had formal training on MS Windows or Office. I’m eternally grateful when someone shows me a useful feature I didn’t know about. I’ve even been known to say “How am I only finding out about this now, this is going to save me loads of time….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll ask you again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?" /><published>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur">&lt;p&gt;May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess. Garry Kasparov, chess grandmaster and world-champion at the time, was beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue 2.5 - 3.5 in a 6 match tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular attention subsequently moved to Go, where humans still had the edge. It took until March of 2016 before Google’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4 - 1. Since, it has been largely accepted that computers can out-compete humans when it comes to strategy board games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after Kasparov’s defeat in 1997, he championed ‘freestyle chess’, to see how far technology could push the level of chess being played by teams made up of anyone or anything. As freestyle tournaments became more common something very interesting happened. Centaurs - humans using readily available chess software and off-the-shelf laptops - were able to win against the most advanced artificial intelligence running on supercomputers. There’s more: the best centaurs weren’t grandmasters, but amateur chess players with backgrounds such as gaming and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In freestyle chess you don’t have to be a grandmaster to beat the best AI. In fact being a grandmaster doesn’t improve your chances as much as being familiar with computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who train themselves using YouTube can now finish DIY projects with a level of quality previously only achieved by professionals who know the ‘trade secrets’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are increasingly focused on retaining organisational knowledge in their processes and systems, reducing the impact of staff turnover. In fact the latest ISO 9001 quality standard is now explicit about this (clause 7.1.6 if you’ve got a copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me the future looks like it belongs to those who, like centaurs, know how to best use technology. Not those who’ve amassed the most knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which case the highest performing businesses will be those who’ve invested in their systems, processes and technology - and focused on making them easy for people to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess.

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you've bought a new car but the dashboard was an optional extra, you spent the money on metallic paint instead....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;/images/Peugeot_206_WRC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peugeot 206 World Rally Championship car on two wheels&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating a factory without knowing the status and health of critical equipment is equivalent to driving a car without knowing the oil temperature or how much fuel is in the tank. Things are fine just now, and might be until you visit a garage... but Sod's law suggests a failure won't come just before the planned outage, but when the plant is under pressure to meet an important deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazier, but no less common, is the purchase of expensive technology then a failure to integrate it with existing systems. I liken this to buying a retro-fit speedometer then allowing the mechanic to install it outside (it's cheaper and easier this way, try to imagine the project has already overspent and overrun....). Now every journey involves slowing, winding down the window to stick your head out - whenever you want to check how far you've come or how fast you're going! Surely paying staff to walk around a site to monitor or control equipment locally is just as inconvenient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, alarms and alerts. Without lights to warn of impending problems, your new car will quickly depreciate in value and lose performance as faults go unnoticed causing lasting damage. I for one am always a little nervous of any taxi driver that can ignore multiple warnings from the dashboard, but at least they haven't taped over the lamps! I see operators of everything from printing presses to power stations with no central display for alarms and warnings. Witnessing alarms being ignored (because they've been there so long) or instruments looped out (because they aren't reliable) frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m in France at the moment, but had a similar experience before Christmas in Ireland. It happens when I need to travel between unfamiliar places without enough time or inclination to properly research the best mode of transport. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, what should have been an easy journey of just 8km turned into a saga lasting several hours thanks to missed buses and failed connections. I’d literally have been better off walking!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repeating the experience in (yet) another place made me think... it’s not the main journey, but the much shorter transfer that often causes problems. The same is true when it comes to transferring data. Most of my clients have robust processes in place for updating their systems, migrating large amounts of historical data or remotely connecting to their control systems. However small, incidental, transfers often slip under the radar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Capturing screenshots to email to a support engineer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Importing a new company logo to update the HMI&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Extracting a one-off alarm report&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the short-term, ensuring individuals are aware of how to reduce the risks associated with USB sticks is a good start. Longer-term your procedures need to provide a quick and easy way to move 'incidental' data or you encourage people to work around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCSC have a lot of guidance on this, much will be overkill for smaller control systems:&lt;/p&gt;

Last week, what should have been an easy journey of just 8km turned into a saga lasting several hours thanks to missed buses and failed connections. I’d literally have been better off walking! Repeating the experience in (yet) another place made me think... it’s not the main journey, but the much shorter transfer that often causes problems. The same is true when it comes to transferring data. Most of my clients have robust processes in place for updating their systems, migrating large amounts of historical data or remotely connecting to their control systems. However small, incidental, transfers often slip under the radar: Capturing screenshots to email to a support engineer Importing a new company logo to update the HMI Extracting a one-off alarm report In the short-term, ensuring individuals are aware of how to reduce the risks associated with USB sticks is a good start. Longer-term your procedures need to provide a quick and easy way to move 'incidental' data or you encourage people to work around them. The NCSC have a lot of guidance on this, much will be overkill for smaller control systems: An architecture pattern for safely importing data into a system from an external source The best solution for you will (as always) depend on the output of your risk assessment: Want a hand with this stuff?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ATT&amp;amp;CK!</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&CK!" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ATT&amp;amp;CK!" /><published>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&amp;CK!</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&amp;CK!">&lt;p&gt;The MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; knowledge base for ICS is now publicly available.
