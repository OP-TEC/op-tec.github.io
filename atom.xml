It may never be possible to eliminate the risk of an unplanned shutdown entirely, but smart use of plant data can significantly reduce it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re sick of praying for things to keep working until the end of the day / week / month / year, keep reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are simple explanations of common maintenance approaches. If you’re new to the concept of data-informed maintenance, know there are companies out there already pushing far beyond these techniques. For example, using machine learning to identify external factors such as weather patterns or employee behaviour to better inform predictions. Or allowing their systems to automatically order spare parts and schedule preventative work before human operators have the chance to notice anything’s up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most likely you’ll say to yourself “we already do this” as you read through. If so, ask whether your existing processes are as effective as they could be. We see people manually undertaking this work &lt;strong&gt;a lot&lt;/strong&gt;, storing records on paper or retrieving it from ‘offline’ equipment only to import it into another system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So read on, then ask: ‘Could my organisation improve it’s maintenance regimes?’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;corrective-maintenance&quot;&gt;Corrective maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait until something breaks, then take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it requires doing nothing this is often seen as the most cost-effective option. Only true if the cost of downtime, in-house expertise, and spare parts is less than those associated with a data-driven approach if this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If equipment in question is critical to operations rapid repair or replacement will be necessary to minimise disruption. Also referred to as reactive maintenance. This approach risks significant costs should catastrophic failure occur, where repair or replacement is not possible within a defined timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No data is needed for this approach. Information available is often used to diagnose the cause of failures after the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. replacing a blown bulb&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preventive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Preventive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervene before failure becomes likely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“When was the cambelt last changed?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance activities are performed before they’re required; typically at predetermined intervals based on historical records or manufacturer recommendations. Sometimes referred to as ‘proactive maintenance’ this technique allows work to be carried out during planned shutdowns minimising disruption. Taking this approach means performing maintenance before it’s needed, so the assumption is the resource needed to do this if cheaper than implementing a more data-driven approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique can be improved over time by using measurement, analysis and periodic testing to better inform service intervals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. changing car engine oil every 10,000 miles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;risk-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Risk-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the impact into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Get that boiler serviced before winter”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effect a failure will have on operations and it’s likelihood is used to allocate available resource efficiently. The condition of assets will also be monitored to ensure changing risks, as equipment and machinery ages, is taken into account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The quantity and quality of data used can vary widely, from the objective analysis of an employee to automated anaylsis of assets over time. It may also be useful to consider factors other than just equipment condition, such as market demand or stock levels.  Information gathered can also inform the schedule for replacing or upgrading equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. waiting until a shutdown to install software updates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;condition-based-maintenance&quot;&gt;Condition-based maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monitor ‘health’ for warning signs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“No signs of wear…“&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maintenance work is informed through performance monitoring of equipment. Typically, key parameters are recorded over time, and trends which indicate pending failure identified. Manual inspection during outages can also be used to determine when work needs to be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automated systems record device parameters over time. Maintenance is required when values deviate from ‘normal’ indicating the probability of a failure has increased to an unacceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. a motor drawing more current than usual&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;predictive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Predictive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specific thresholds for action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What does this warning light mean?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are automatically alerted when specific scenarios are detected. The characteristics and failure modes of an asset will be known, so when partnered with condition monitoring pending failure can be detected and people warned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on how sophisticated a piece of equipment is, this may be a single error or warning light or a detailed fault code which accurately indentifies the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. car running in “limp mode” until it’s taken to the garage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;prescriptive-maintenance&quot;&gt;Prescriptive maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recommended action provided.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The freezer says it needs defrosting”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Users receive specific recommended actions to prevent failure. So rather than a description of the problem, they are given information about the action they need to take to avoid a failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No time is needed to fault-find or diagnose problems, as the piece of equipment states exacty what is required to address the situation. This also reduces the skill and expertise personnel need to be able to operate and maintain the asset. Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) may provide this functionality for ‘user serviceable’ equipment, but ensure that more complicated or costly fixes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. dashboard: check tyre pressures&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reliability-centered-maintenance&quot;&gt;Reliability-centered maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the best maintenance approach for each asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We can’t suffer a failure”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Past breakdowns are analysed to identify the best maintenance approach for each item of equipment, based on it’s historic and/or anticipated reliability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this instance an assets performance and reliability inform the most appropriate maintenance regime. New equipment will be maintained largely in line with the manufacturers recommendations. Then more weight given to historical records of condition and failure rate as the equipment ages. Like risk-based maintenance, when implemented properly this method is labour intensive, requiring knowledge of an assets’ failure modes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;e.g. establishing the safe minimum level of maintenance for an aircraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Projects</name><email>cornelius@thewhip.com</email></author><category term="knowledge" /><summary type="html">How you use data analysis to inform maintenance activity can have a huge impact on the efficiency of your operations.

&lt;p&gt;If it’s negligible, or an afterthought when improvements aren’t realised, how do things look now?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a graduate engineer I was baffled when my old employer moved to a newer version of Windows. They put on a huge number of training courses offering staff the chance to learn the new features available in the operating system and Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me it looked like a huge waste of time and money. Surely everyone has a computer at home? Surely people keep up with current technology and ways of working in their own time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was wrong, some do. Most don’t. Looking back, I’ve no doubt the training was worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m still doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never had formal training on MS Windows or Office. I’m eternally grateful when someone shows me a useful feature I didn’t know about. I’ve even been known to say “How am I only finding out about this now, this is going to save me loads of time….”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I’ll ask you again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">When you purchase new equipment or technology how much do you invest in training people?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Picture1.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Are you a grandmaster or a centaur?" /><published>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-10-07T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/are-you-a-grandmaster-or-a-centaur">&lt;p&gt;May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess. Garry Kasparov, chess grandmaster and world-champion at the time, was beaten by IBM’s Deep Blue 2.5 - 3.5 in a 6 match tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Popular attention subsequently moved to Go, where humans still had the edge. It took until March of 2016 before Google’s AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4 - 1. Since, it has been largely accepted that computers can out-compete humans when it comes to strategy board games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However after Kasparov’s defeat in 1997, he championed ‘freestyle chess’, to see how far technology could push the level of chess being played by teams made up of anyone or anything. As freestyle tournaments became more common something very interesting happened. Centaurs - humans using readily available chess software and off-the-shelf laptops - were able to win against the most advanced artificial intelligence running on supercomputers. There’s more: the best centaurs weren’t grandmasters, but amateur chess players with backgrounds such as gaming and programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this tell us?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In freestyle chess you don’t have to be a grandmaster to beat the best AI. In fact being a grandmaster doesn’t improve your chances as much as being familiar with computers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who train themselves using YouTube can now finish DIY projects with a level of quality previously only achieved by professionals who know the ‘trade secrets’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies are increasingly focused on retaining organisational knowledge in their processes and systems, reducing the impact of staff turnover. In fact the latest ISO 9001 quality standard is now explicit about this (clause 7.1.6 if you’ve got a copy).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me the future looks like it belongs to those who, like centaurs, know how to best use technology. Not those who’ve amassed the most knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In which case the highest performing businesses will be those who’ve invested in their systems, processes and technology - and focused on making them easy for people to use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Richard Banyard</name><email>richard.banyard@op-tec.co.uk</email></author><category term="latest" /><summary type="html">May 1997 was a turning point in the world of chess.

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you've bought a new car but the dashboard was an optional extra, you spent the money on metallic paint instead....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;img width=&quot;200&quot; src=&quot;/images/Peugeot_206_WRC.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Peugeot 206 World Rally Championship car on two wheels&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating a factory without knowing the status and health of critical equipment is equivalent to driving a car without knowing the oil temperature or how much fuel is in the tank. Things are fine just now, and might be until you visit a garage... but Sod's law suggests a failure won't come just before the planned outage, but when the plant is under pressure to meet an important deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crazier, but no less common, is the purchase of expensive technology then a failure to integrate it with existing systems. I liken this to buying a retro-fit speedometer then allowing the mechanic to install it outside (it's cheaper and easier this way, try to imagine the project has already overspent and overrun....). Now every journey involves slowing, winding down the window to stick your head out - whenever you want to check how far you've come or how fast you're going! Surely paying staff to walk around a site to monitor or control equipment locally is just as inconvenient?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, alarms and alerts. Without lights to warn of impending problems, your new car will quickly depreciate in value and lose performance as faults go unnoticed causing lasting damage. I for one am always a little nervous of any taxi driver that can ignore multiple warnings from the dashboard, but at least they haven't taped over the lamps! I see operators of everything from printing presses to power stations with no central display for alarms and warnings. Witnessing alarms being ignored (because they've been there so long) or instruments looped out (because they aren't reliable) frequently.&lt;/p&gt;

The NCSC have a lot of guidance on this, much will be overkill for smaller control systems: An architecture pattern for safely importing data into a system from an external source The best solution for you will (as always) depend on the output of your risk assessment: Want a hand with this stuff?</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22%7D" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://op-tec.co.uk/%7B%22teaser%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22,%20%22thumb%22=%3E%22Stansted_Airport_Transit_route_diagram.jpg%22%7D" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">ATT&amp;amp;CK!</title><link href="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&CK!" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="ATT&amp;amp;CK!" /><published>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-01-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&amp;CK!</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://op-tec.co.uk/latest/ATT&amp;CK!">&lt;p&gt;The MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;sup&gt;&amp;reg;&lt;/sup&gt; knowledge base for ICS is now publicly available.

If you are still using RS3 you've likely benefitted from many years of trouble-free service from a system that doesn't need a lot of routine maintenance. For this reason the justification for putting off migration to a newer control system has been easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.emerson.com/en-us/catalog/deltav-rs3&quot;&gt;Emerson Automation Solutions&lt;/a&gt; withdrew on-demand support for the RS3 DCS in October 2013. Since then Emerson has only offered factory support to users of this legacy system via it's 'Sustain Program' intended to migrate users onto it's DeltaV platform. You may be one of those still running RS3 equipment because it has proved hugely reliable and the cost of replacement or migration is prohibitively expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op-tec Systems has supported customers with RS3 equipment for over 20 years. For some of our clients RS3 remains their main DCS, others have gradually de-commissioned it as they have migrated to up-to-date &lt;a href=&quot;/latest/control-system-types&quot;&gt;PLC-SCADA&lt;/a&gt; or DCS solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons for replacing RS3 tend to focus on HMI components. Thirty years of use takes its toll on keyboards and trackballs and failures start to occur. Op-tec have some ingenious solutions to these challenges, and have given aging systems a new lease of life, restoring performance to ‘as new’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RS3 DCS comprises:
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Operator Consoles (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface&quot;&gt;HMI&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;ControlFiles, with associated Card Cages (holding &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output&quot;&gt;I/O&lt;/a&gt; modules)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Interfaces to external systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These components communicate via a redundant PeerWay communications highway. RS3 is capable of controlling continuous and batch processes, via Rosemount Basic Language (RBL) programming and later ABC Batch Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the proprietary nature of RS3 there are limited ways to integrate it efficiently with modern systems. Emerson can offer migration to their latest technology incrementally, while other major vendors tend to recommend an 'all or nothing' rip and replace approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can help plan a RS3 replacement, by reverse engineering the programming of your current system, evaluating your needs and likely future requirements and supplying a lifecycle management plan for a phased, incremental migration; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_engineering&quot;&gt;FEED&lt;/a&gt; study if you have already decided to replace your system in one go. Our reverse engineering services save significant amounts of redesign and specification work.&lt;/p&gt;
