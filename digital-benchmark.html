				<p class="tab justify">Whether you're just starting to look at an investment in automation, or looking to get more from your existing technology, this report will show you where you are in relation to best practice and what your next steps should be.</p>
				<p class="tab justify">Automation suppliers, vendors and solutions providers want to sell you the products they've invested huge amounts in developing/getting familiar with, not the technology which best delivers your strategic objectives.</p>

				<p class="tab justify">It takes less than a minute to complete the questionnaire, and another minute for us to deliver a customised PDF report to your inbox:</p>

				<p class="tab justify">Why are we providing this service free of charge? We're passionate about helping companies increase their efficiency through better investment in technology, but know our services won't be right for everyone. By making our expertise available to all we get to help a larger number of people, and hope some will see our approach as a good fit with their objectives and want to take things further.</p>
				<p class="tab justify">Why should you listen to what we say? We've been helping organisations, big and small, maximise the return they see from automation investment for decades.</p>
