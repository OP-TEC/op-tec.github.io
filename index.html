                <p>Yes.</p>
                <p>Longer answer: your specific requirements and current technology determine the solution we will offer. Almost everything we work with could be termed 'Industry 4.0'. To learn more about Industry 4.0, and the distinction between this term and the 'forth industrial revolution' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_4.0">Wikipedia's definition</a> is a good place to start.</p>

                <h5 id="anything-to-do-with-digital-transformation">Is this anything to do with digital transformation?</h5>
                <p>Everything! We specialise in moving companies to being 'data-driven' enterprises. Unless you're still faxing purchase orders you'll be some way towards this goal already. But chances are you could do more to gather and use data to make better decisions in real-time.</p>
                <p style="text-align:right"><small><small><a href="#FAQs">Back to questions</a></small></small></p>
                <h5 id="How-are-you-different">How are you different?</h5>
                <p>As an independent service provider, it's not in our interest to sell you expensive hardware or software. We measure success on your business performance. By recommending the most cost-effective method for achieving your goals we ensure you get the best return on investment possible.</p>
                <p>Many potential clients we speak to think investing in Industry 4.0 technology requires huge capital investment, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. It is possible to retro-fit sensors to existing equipment and the return on investment of doing so can be huge.</p>
                <p>Op-tec is well-known for supporting legacy systems and we always try to utilise as much of your existing technology as possible. Extending the life of equipment makes economic and environmental sense, so we will always recommend doing so if it's a viable option.</p>

        <h2>Want to find out more about our approach before committing to anything?</h2>
        <p>Generating a Digital Benchmark Report&trade; is a good first step. You won't be added to a mailing list and no one will call "following up". It's a tool we use with clients to help guage how effectively they're implementing their automation strategy. There's no real cost to us making it available to anyone and we believe the best way for new clients to get to know us is by doing some work for them.</p>
