    <title>Support available for Emerson RS3 • Op-tec Systems</title>
    <meta name="description" content="The Rosemount System 3 (RS3) DCS can still be found controlling a variety of industrial processes today, after first being installed in 1984. If you are still using RS3 you've likely benefitted from many years of trouble-free service from a system that doesn't need a lot of routine maintenance. For this reason the justification for putting off migration to a newer control system has been easy.
Emerson Automation Solutions withdrew on-demand support for the RS3 DCS in October 2013. Since then Emerson has only offered factory support to users of this legacy system via it's 'Sustain Program' intended to migrate users onto it's DeltaV platform. You may be one of those still running RS3 equipment because it has proved hugely reliable and the cost of replacement or migration is prohibitively expensive.
Op-tec Systems has supported customers with RS3 equipment for over 20 years. For some of our clients RS3 remains their main DCS, others have gradually de-commissioned it as they have migrated to up-to-date PLC-SCADA or DCS solutions.
The reasons for replacing RS3 tend to focus on HMI components. Thirty years of use takes its toll on keyboards and trackballs and failures start to occur. Op-tec have some ingenious solutions to these challenges, and have given aging systems a new lease of life, restoring performance to ‘as new’.
 &nbsp;

The RS3 DCS comprises:

    Operator Consoles (HMI)
    ControlFiles, with associated Card Cages (holding I/O modules)
    Interfaces to external systems

These components communicate via a redundant PeerWay communications highway. RS3 is capable of controlling continuous and batch processes, via Rosemount Basic Language (RBL) programming and later ABC Batch Studio.
Because of the proprietary nature of RS3 there are limited ways to integrate it efficiently with modern systems. Emerson can offer migration to their latest technology incrementally, while other major vendors tend to recommend an 'all or nothing' rip and replace approach.
We can help plan a RS3 replacement, by reverse engineering the programming of your current system, evaluating your needs and likely future requirements and supplying a lifecycle management plan for a phased, incremental migration; or FEED study if you have already decided to replace your system in one go. Our reverse engineering services save significant amounts of redesign and specification work.
While you continue to run RS3 equipment we can provide service support, giving you the reassurance of having engineering expertise available as and when you need it. Our development systems are also available to test spares and validate backup files.
If you would like to speak to one of our engineers about your RS3 installation, to understand the options available to you, get in touch.">
