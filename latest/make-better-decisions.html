    <title>Have you got what it takes to make decisions? â€¢ Op-tec Systems</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Tough decisions are never easy, even with the right information. So asking yourself or someone else to make a serious decision, with information that is presented poorly, not current or even relevant, isn't a good idea.
However many control system users are doing this everyday by using poorly designed or maintained Human Machine Interfaces (HMI).
The purpose of a HMI is to provide information to system users, allowing them to make decisions. However, good HMI design takes time, time that is often 'saved' when projects are delivered. This leaves a legacy of control systems with terrible user interfaces, which at best waste time and energy, but at worst represent a significant risk to plant personnel and equipment.
A good opportunity to improve displays comes when systems are upgraded. Unfortunately there is often the same pressure to save time and money, along with reluctance from system users to make changes to interfaces they are familiar with.
This is unfortunate, as good HMI design can reduce load on users while improving their effectiveness. Often the time delay between an undesirable event occurring and a remedial action being taken is significant, wasting resources and impacting profitability.
Op-tec always recommend software well equipped with display objects compliant with industry best practise, for example EEMUA 201 and HSE guidance.
