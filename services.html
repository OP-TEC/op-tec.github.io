					</div>
				</div>
				<br />
				<p><b><i>Need to improve productivity and want to know what's possible?</i></b></p>
				<p>An Op-tec Intelligence Report gives you a high-level review of your current situation and an automation strategy capable of delivering the results you're after.</p>
				<br />
				<p><b><i>What will it do for you?</i></b></p>

				<p><b><i>What do you get?</i></b></p>
				<p>A high-level report giving an automation strategy aligned with your business objectives. Detailed recommendations for technology which may be installed incrementally or as a turn-key project.</p>
				<br />
				<p><b><i>How to get started?</i></b></p>
				<p>To understand how you're working now and your vision for the future we'll need a <b>1 hour call</b>. You'll have the report <b>5 working days</b> after this session.</p>
				<p>The report will contain home truths, hard facts and actionable recommendations. We'll uncover 'easy-wins' and 'no-brainers' based on the return on investment you'll achieve, not technology it's profitable for us to implement. These will be followed up with suggested approaches for the medium and long-term to secure the future of your business.</p>
